Abstract

Overcoming the limited context limitations in early-generation LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been a reliable solution for context-based answer generation in the past. Recently, the emergence of long-context LLMs allows the models to incorporate much longer text sequences, making RAG less attractive. Recent studies show that long-context LLMs significantly outperform RAG in long-context applications. Unlike the existing works favor- ing the long-context LLM over RAG, we ar- gue that the extremely long context in LLMs suffers from a diminished focus on relevant in- formation and leads to potential degradation in answer quality. This paper revisits the RAG in long-context answer generation. We propose an order-preserve retrieval-augmented genera- tion (OP-RAG) mechanism, which significantly improves the performance of RAG for long- context question-answer applications. With OP-RAG, as the number of retrieved chunks increases, the answer quality initially rises, and then declines, forming an inverted U-shaped curve. There exist sweet points where OP-RAG could achieve higher answer quality with much less tokens than long-context LLM taking the whole context as input. Extensive experiments on public benchmark demonstrate the superior- ity of our OP-RAG.

Introduction

Due to the limited context window length (eg, 4096) of early-generation large language models (LLMs), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020) is an indispensable choice to handle a large-scale context corpus. Since the answer quality is heavily depen- dent on the performance of the retrieval model, a lot of efforts are devoted to improving the retrieval recall/precision when designing the RAG system. Recently, the state-of-art LLMs support much longer context windows. For example, GPT- 4O (OpenAI, 2023), Claudi-3.5 (Anthropic, 2024),

Llama3.1 (Meta, 2024b), Phi-3 (Abdin et al., 2024), and Mistral-Large2 (AI, 2024) all support 128-K context. Gemini-1.5-pro even supports a 1M con- text window. The recent emergence of long-context LLMs naturally leads to the question: is RAG nec- essary in the age of long-context LLMs? Li et al. (2024) recently systematically compares RAG with long-context (LC) LLMs (w/o RAG) and demon- strates that LC LLMs consistently outperform RAG in terms of answer quality."|research_papers\In_Defense_of_RAG_in_the_Era_of_Long-Context_Langu.pdf|ec3e40cb466a4a26961aedfc7aed03a3
"In this work, we re-examine the effectiveness of RAG in long-context answer generation. We observe that the order of retrieved chunks in the

context of LLM is vital for the answer quality. Dif- ferent from traditional RAG which places the re- trieved chunks in a relevance-descending order, we propose to preserve the order of retrieved chunks in the original text. Our experiments show that the proposed order-preserving mechanism significantly improves the answer quality of RAG."|research_papers\In_Defense_of_RAG_in_the_Era_of_Long-Context_Langu.pdf|65258eb7f65c4a319617dff45f514916
Meanwhile, using the proposed order-preserve RAG, as the number of retrieved chunks increases, the answer quality initially rises and then declines. This is because, with more retrieved chunks, the model has access to more potentially relevant in- formation, which improves the chances of retriev- ing the correct context needed to generate a high- quality answer. However, as more chunks are re- trieved, the likelihood of introducing irrelevant or distracting information also increases. This excess information can confuse the model, leading to a decline in answer quality. The trade-off, therefore, is between improving recall by retrieving more context and maintaining precision by limiting dis- tractions. The optimal point is where the balance between relevant and irrelevant information maxi- mizes the quality of the answer. Beyond this point, the introduction of too much irrelevant information degrades the model’s performance. It explains the inferior performance of the approach taking the whole long context as the input of LLM.|research_papers\In_Defense_of_RAG_in_the_Era_of_Long-Context_Langu.pdf|f001661ed65a416dadfdb6906837b6e8
"Different from the conclusion from Li et al. (2024), with the proposed order-preserving mech- anism, RAG achieves higher answer quality com- pared with its counterparts that rely solely on Long- Context LLMs. As shown in Figure 4a, On En.QA dataset of ∞Bench (Zhang et al., 2024), using only 16K retrieved tokens, we achieve 44.43 F1 score with Llama3.1-70B. In contrast, without RAG, Llama3.1-70B making full use of 128K context only achieves 34.32 F1 score, GPT-4O achieves only 32.36 F1 score and Gemini-1.5-Pro obtains only 43.08 F1 score as evaluated by Li et al. (2024). That is, RAG could achieve a higher F1 score even with a significant reduction on input length.

By incorporat- ing the external knowledge as context, retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Mialon et al., 2023) allows lan- guage model to access up-to-date and specific in- formation, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy.

"LLMs, RAG is a promising solution to overcoming the limitation of short context window. Long-context LLM. To support the long sequence of language models, many efforts have been de- voted to improving the computing efficiency of self-attention (Choromanski et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020; Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2024) and boosting extensibility of positional en- coding (Press et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). Recently, the flagship LLMs such as GPT-4O (OpenAI, 2023), Gemini-1.5-Pro (Reid et al., 2024), Claudi-3.5 (Anthropic, 2024), Grok- 2 (xAI, 2024), and Llama3.1 (Meta, 2024a) have supported extremely large context. With the ex- istence of long-context LLMs, RAG is no longer a indispensable module for long-context question- answering task. Recently, Li et al. (2024) con- cludes that using long-context without RAG could significantly outperforms RAG. Different from the conclusion from (Li et al., 2024), in this work, we demonstrate the proposed order-preserve RAG could beat the long-context LLMs without RAG.

Let us denote the long textual context, e.g., a long document, by d. We split d into N chunks sequen- tially and uniformly, {ci}N i=1. The index i implies the sequential order of the chunk ci in d. That is, ci−1 denotes the chunk before ci whereas ci+1 de- notes the chunk right after ci. Given a query q, we obtain the relevance score of the chunk ci by com- puting cosine similarity between the embedding of q and that of ci:

si = cos(emb(q), emb(ci)),

To be specific, En.QA consists of 351 human-annotated question-answer pairs. On av- erage, the long context in En.QA contains 150,374 words. We use F1-score as metric for evaluation on En.QA. EN.MC consists of 224 question-answer pairs, which are annotated similarly to En.QA, but each question is provided with four answer choices. On average, the long context in En.MC contains 142,622 words. We use accuracy as metric for eval- uation on En.QA. We notice there is another bench- mark termed LongBench (Bai et al., 2023). Never-

The influence of context length. We evaluate the influence of the context length on the perfor- mance of the proposed order-preserve RAG. Since each chunk contains 128 tokens, the context length is 128m, where m is the number of the retrieved chunks as the context for generating the answer. As shown in Figure 3, as the context length increases, the performance initially increases. This is because more context might have a greater chance of cover- ing the relevant chunk. Nevertheless, as the context length further increases, the answer quality drops since more irrelevant chunks are used as distrac- tions. To be specific, Llama3.1-8B model achieves the performance peak when the context length is 16K on both EN.QA dataset and EN.MC dataset, whereas the best performance of Llama3.1-70B model is achieved at 48K on EN.QA and 32K on EN.MC. The fact that the peak point of Llama3.1- 70B comes later than Llama3.1-8B model might be because the larger-scale model has a stronger capability to distinguish the relevant chunks from

As shown in Figure 4, when the number of retrieved chunks are small (e.g, 8), the advantage of the pro- posed order-preserve RAG over vanilla RAG is not considerably. In contrast, when the number of re- trieved chunks is large, our order-preserve RAG significantly outperforms vanilla RAG. To be spe- cific, on EN.QA dataset, when the number of re- trieved chunk is 128, vanilla RAG only achieves 38.40 F1-score whereas our order-preserve RAG achieves 44.43 F1-score.

"4.4 Main Results

We compare the proposed order-preserve RAG with two types of baselines. The first category of ap- proaches uses the long-context LLM without RAG. As shown in Table 1, without RAG, LLM takes a huge number of tokens as input, which is inefficient and costly. In contrast, the proposed order-preserve RAG not only significantly reduces the number of tokens, but also significantly improves the answer quality. For instance, using Llama3.1-70B model, the approach without RAG only achieves a 34.26 F1 score on EN.QA with an average of 117K to- kens as input. In contrast, our OP-RAG with 48K tokens as input attains a 47.25 F1 score. The sec- ond category of baselines takes the SELF-ROUTE mechanism (Li et al., 2024), which routes queries to RAG or long-context LLM based on the model self-reflection. As shown in Table 1, ours signifi-

cantly outperforms than using much fewer tokens in the input of LLMs.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have revisited the role of retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) in the era of long- context language models (LLMs). While recent trends have favored long-context LLMs over RAG for their ability to incorporate extensive text se- quences, our research challenges this perspective. We argue that extremely long contexts in LLMs can lead to a diminished focus on relevant infor- mation, potentially degrading answer quality in question-answering tasks. To address this issue, we proposed the order-preserve retrieval-augmented generation (OP-RAG) mechanism. Our extensive experiments on public benchmarks have demon- strated that OP-RAG significantly improves the

performance of RAG for long-context question- answer applications. OP-RAG’s superior perfor- mance suggests that efficient retrieval and focused context utilization can outperform the brute-force approach of processing extremely long contexts.

has markedly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of “retrieve-then-generate”. In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns—linear, conditional, branching, and looping—and offers a comprehensive analysis their respective implementation nuances.

limitations of Naive RAG have become increasingly apparent. As depicted in Figure 1, it predominantly hinges on the straightforward similarity of chunks, result in poor perfor- mance when confronted with complex queries and chunks with substantial variability. The primary challenges of Naive RAG include: 1) Shallow Understanding of Queries. The semantic similarity between a query and document chunk is not always highly consistent. Relying solely on similarity calculations for retrieval lacks an in-depth exploration of the relationship between the query and the document [8]. 2) Retrieval Re- dundancy and Noise. Feeding all retrieved chunks directly into LLMs is not always beneficial. Research indicates that an excess of redundant and noisy information may interfere thereby with the LLM’s identification of key information, increasing the risk of generating erroneous and hallucinated responses.

"To overcome the aforementioned limitations, Advanced RAG paradigm focuses on optimizing the retrieval phase, aiming to enhance retrieval efficiency and strengthen the utilization of retrieved chunks. As shown in Figure 1 ,typical strategies involve pre-retrieval processing and post-retrieval processing. For instance, query rewriting is used to make the queries more clear and specific, thereby increasing the accuracy of retrieval [10], and the reranking of retrieval results is employed to enhance the LLM’s ability to identify and utilize key information [11].

I. INTRODUCTION

they still face numerous challenges, such as hallucination and the lag in information up- dates [1]. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), by access- ing external knowledge bases, provides LLMs with important contextual information, significantly enhancing their perfor- mance on knowledge-intensive tasks [2]. Currently, RAG, as an enhancement method, has been widely applied in various practical application scenarios, including knowledge question answering, recommendation systems, customer service, and personal assistants.

"Despite the improvements in the practicality of Advanced RAG, there remains a gap between its capabilities and real- world application requirements. On one hand, as RAG tech- nology advances, user expectations rise, demands continue to evolve, and application settings become more complex. For instance, the integration of heterogeneous data and the new demands for system transparency, control, and maintainability. On the other hand, the growth in application demands has further propelled the evolution of RAG technology.

As shown in Figure 2, to achieve more accurate and efficient task execution, modern RAG systems are progressively inte- grating more sophisticated function, such as organizing more refined index base in the form of knowledge graphs, integrat- ing structured data through query construction methods, and employing fine-tuning techniques to enable encoders to better adapt to domain-specific documents.

and maintainability. With the increasing complexity of sys- tems, system maintenance and debugging have become more challenging. Additionally, when issues arise, it is essential to quickly pinpoint the specific components that require opti- mization.

Component selection and optimization. More neural net- works are involved in the RAG system, necessitating the selection of appropriate components to meet the needs of spe- cific tasks and resource configurations. Moreover, additional components enhance the effectiveness of RAG but also bring new collaborative work requirements [17]. Ensuring that these models perform as intended and work efficiently together to enhance the overall system performance is crucial.

To address the design, management, and maintenance chal- lenges posed by the increasing complexity of RAG systems, and to meet the ever-growing and diverse demands and ex- pectations, this paper proposes Modular RAG architecture.

"The Modular RAG system consists of multiple independent yet tightly coordinated modules, each responsible for handling specific functions or tasks. This architecture is divided into three levels: the top level focuses on the critical stages of RAG, where each stage is treated as an independent module. This level not only inherits the main processes from the Advanced RAG paradigm but also introduces an orchestration module to control the coordination of RAG processes. The middle level is composed of sub-modules within each module, further refining and optimizing the functions. The bottom level consists of basic units of operation—operators. Within the Modular RAG framework, RAG systems can be represented in the form of computational graphs, where nodes represent specific operators. The comparison of the three paradigms is shown in the Figure 3. Modular RAG evolves based on the previous development of RAG. The relationships among these three paradigms are ones of inheritance and development. Advanced RAG is a special case of Modular RAG, while Naive RAG is a special case of Advanced RAG.

The advantages of Modular RAG are significant, as it enhances the flexibility and scalability of RAG systems. Users can flexibly combine different modules and operators accord- ing to the requirements of data sources and task scenarios.

"This paper proposes a new paradigm called modular RAG, which employs a three-tier architectural design comprising modules, sub-modules, and operators to de- fine the RAG system in a unified and structured manner. This design not only enhances the system’s flexibility and scalability but also, through the independent design of

operators, strengthens the system’s maintainability and comprehensibility.

Under the framework of Modular RAG, the orchestration of modules and operators forms the RAG Flow, which can flexibly express current RAG methods. This paper has further summarized six typical flow patterns and specific methods have been analyzed to reveal the universality of modular RAG in practical scenarios.

The development of RAG technology can be summarized in three stages. Initially, retrieval-augmented techniques were introduced to improve the performance of pre-trained lan- guage models on knowledge-intensive tasks [19], [20]. In specific implementations, Retro [21] optimized pre-trained autoregressive models through retrieval augmentation, while Atlas [22] utilized a retrieval-augmented few-shot fine-tuning method, enabling language models to adapt to diverse tasks. IRCOT [23] further enriched the reasoning process during the inference phase by combining chain-of-thought and multi- step retrieval processes. Entering the second stage, as the language processing capabilities of LLMs significantly im- proved, retrieval-augmented techniques began to serve as a means of supplementing additional knowledge and providing references, aiming to reduce the hallucination. For instance, RRR [24] improved the rewriting phase, and LLMlingua [25] removed redundant tokens in retrieved document chunks. With the continuous progress of RAG technology, research has become more refined and focused, while also achieving innovative integration with other technologies such as graph neural networks [26] and fine-tuning techniques [27]. The overall pipeline has also become more flexible, such as using LLMs to proactively determine the timing of retrieval and generation [14], [28].|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|a5e893eb8a9e4be2a9e7b4fbbb75e20b

Based on the main processes of RAG, relevant works on RAG were organized from the perspectives of retrieval, generation, and augmentation methods. Huang et al., [29] categorize RAG methods into four main classes: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, generation, and provide a detailed discussion of the methods and techniques within each class.

"TABLE I IMPORTANT NOTATION

The current collation of RAG systems primarily focuses on methods with a fixed process, mainly concerned with optimizing the retrieval and generation stages. However, it has not turned its attention to the new characteristics that RAG research is continuously evolving, namely the characteristics of process scheduling and functional componentization. There is currently a lack of comprehensive analysis of the overall RAG system, which has led to research on paradigms lagging behind the development of RAG technology.

III. FRAMEWORK AND NOTATION

For query Q = {qi}, a typical RAG system mainly consists of three key components. 1) Indexing. Given documents D = {d1, d2, . . . , dn} , where di represents the document chunk. Indexing is the process of converting di into vectors through an embedding model fe(·) , and then store vectors in vector database.

I = {e1, e2, . . . , en} and ei = fe(di) ∈ Rd

2) Retrieval . Transform the query into a vector using the same encoding model, and then filter out the top k document chunks that are most similar based on vector similarity. (2)

Dq = {d1, d2, . . . , dk} represents the relevant documents for question q. The similarity function Sim(·) commonly used are dot product or cosine similarity.

3) Generation. After getting the relevant documents. The query q and the retrieved document Dq chunks are inputted together to the LLM to generate the final answer, where [·, ·] stands for concatenation. (4)

With the evolution of RAG technology, more and more func- tional components are being integrated into systems. Modular RAG paradigm includes three levels, ranging from large to small:

L1 Module (M = {Ms}). The core process in RAG

system.

L2 Sub-module (Ms = {Op}).The functional modules in

module.

L3 Operator (Op = {fθi}). The the specific functional implementation in a module or sub-module. As a result, a Modular RAG system can be represented as:

G = {q, D, M, {Ms}, {Op}}

The arrangement between modules and operators constitutes the RAG Flow F = (Mϕ1, . . . , Mϕn ) where ϕ stands for the set of module parameters. A modular rag flow can be decomposed into a graph of sub-functions. In the simplest case,the graph is a linear chain.

IV. MODULE AND OPERATOR

This chapter will specifically introduce modules and op- erators under the Modular RAG framework. Based on the current stage of RAG development, we have established six main modules: Indexing, Pre-retrieval, Retrieval, Post- retrieval, Generation, and Orchestration.

A. Indexing

Indexing is the process of split document into manageable chunks and it is a key step in organizing a system. Indexing faces three main challenges. 1) Incomplete content represen- tation.The semantic information of chunks is influenced by the segmentation method, resulting in the loss or submergence of important information within longer contexts. 2) Inaccurate chunk similarity search. As data volume increases, noise in retrieval grows, leading to frequent matching with erroneous data, making the retrieval system fragile and unreliable. 3) Unclear reference trajectory. The retrieved chunks may orig- inate from any document, devoid of citation trails, potentially resulting in the presence of chunks from multiple different documents that, despite being semantically similar, contain content on entirely different topics."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|a8d9717c3f3e4f22bda7bc435ba79215
"1) Chunk Optimization: The size of the chunks and the overlap between the chunks play a crucial role in the overall effectiveness of the RAG system. Given a chunk di, its chunk size is denoted as Li = |di|, and the overlap is denoted as Lo i = |di ∩ di+1|. Larger chunks can capture more context, but they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing time and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully convey the necessary context, they do have less noise [17]. Sliding Window using overlapping chunks in a sliding win- dow enhances semantic transitions. However, it has limitations such as imprecise context size control, potential truncation of words or sentences, and lacking semantic considerations.

Metadata Attachment. Chunks can be enriched with meta- data like page number, file name, author, timestamp, sum- mary, or relevant questions. This metadata allows for filtered retrieval, narrowing the search scope."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|64513e23f8064395bf825e4fd252cfbd
"Small-to-Big [33] separate the chunks used for retrieval from those used for synthesis. Smaller chunks enhance re- trieval accuracy, while larger chunks provide more context. One approach is to retrieve smaller summarized chunks and reference their parent larger chunks. Alternatively, individual sentences could be retrieved along with their surrounding text. 2) Structure Organization: One effective method for en- hancing information retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for the documents. By constructing chunks structure, RAG system can expedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.

Hierarchical Index. In the hierarchical structure of docu- ments, nodes are arranged in parent-child relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data summaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal of data and assisting the RAG system in determining which chunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion caused by chunk extraction issues. The methods for constructing a structured index primarily include: 1) Structural awareness based on paragraph and sentence segmentation in docs. 2) Content awareness based on inherent structure in PDF, HTML, and Latex. 3) Semantic awareness based on semantic recognition and segmentation of text."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|69384244a96a44f489bc8d43b3cefdda
"KG Index [34]. Using Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to struc- ture documents helps maintain consistency by clarifying con- nections between concepts and entities, reducing the risk of mismatch errors. KGs also transform information retrieval into instructions intelligible to language models, improving re- trieval accuracy and enabling contextually coherent responses. This enhances the overall efficiency of the RAG system. For example, organizing a corpus in the format of graph G = {V, E, X }, where node V = {vi}n i=1 represent document structures (e.g.passage, pages, table) , edge E ⊂ V × V rep- resent semantic or lexical similarity and belonging relations, and node features X = {Xi}n i=1 represent text or markdown content for passage.

B. Pre-retrieval

One of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its direct reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for retrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult, and imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness. The primary challenges in this module include: 1) Poorly worded queries. The question itself is complex, and the language is not well-organized. 2) Language complexity and ambiguity. Language models often struggle when dealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbreviations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not discern whether LLM refers to Large Language Model or a Master of Laws in a legal context."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|7bc5cdd950b14811b56428c628358787
"1) Query Expansion : Expanding a single query into mul- tiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing

5

further context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby ensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.

fqe(q) = {q1, q2, . . . , qn} ∀qi ∈ {q1, q2, . . . , qn}, qi /∈ Q

(7) Multi-Query uses prompt engineering to expand queries via LLMs, allowing for parallel execution. These expansions are meticulously designed to ensure diversity and coverage. However, this approach can dilute the user’s original intent. To mitigate this, the model can be instructed to assign greater weight to the original query.

Sub-Query. By decomposing and planning for complex problems, multiple sub-problems are generated. Specifically, least-to-most prompting [35] can be employed to decom- pose the complex problem into a series of simpler sub- problems. Depending on the structure of the original problem, the generated sub-problems can be executed in parallel or sequentially. Another approach involves the use of the Chain- of-Verification (CoVe) [36]. The expanded queries undergo validation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing hallu- cinations.

2) Query Transformation: Retrieve and generate based on

a transformed query instead of the user’s original query.

"2) Query Transformation: Retrieve and generate based on

fqt(q) = q′

Rewrite. Original queries often fall short for retrieval in real-world scenarios. To address this, LLMs can be prompted to rewrite. Specialized smaller models can also be employed for this purpose [24]. The implementation of the query rewrite method in Taobao has significantly improved recall effective- ness for long-tail queries, leading to an increase in GMV [10]. HyDE [37]. In order to bridge the semantic gap between questions and answers, it constructs hypothetical documents (assumed answers) when responding to queries instead of directly searching the query. It focuses on embedding simi- larity from answer to answer rather than seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query. In addition, it also in- cludes reverse HyDE, which generate hypothetical query for each chunks and focuses on retrieval from query to query.

Step-back Prompting [38]. The original query is abstracted into a high-level concept question (step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back question and the original query are used for retrieval, and their results are combined to generate the language model’s answer.

3) Query Construction:"|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|db70c9e2a05a466db86621f7432e3b86
"3) Query Construction:

In addition to text data, an in- creasing amount of structured data, such as tables and graph data, is being integrated into RAG systems. To accommodate various data types, it is necessary to restructure the user’s query. This involve converting the query into another query language to access alternative data sources, with common methods including Text-to-SQL or Text-to-Cypher . In many scenarios, structured query languages (e.g., SQL, Cypher) are often used in conjunction with semantic information and metadata to construct more complex queries.

fqc(q) = q∗, q∗ ∈ Q∗ = {SQL, Cypher, . . . }

C. Retrieval

The retrieval process is pivotal in RAG systems. By lever- aging powerful embedding models, queries and text can be efficiently represented in latent spaces, which facilitates the establishment of semantic similarity between questions and documents, thereby enhancing retrieval. Three main consider- ations that need to be addressed include retrieval efficiency, quality, and the alignment of tasks, data and models."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|3622681c6ae34106a9ced2f242c8ef51
"1) Retriever Selection: With the widespread adoption of RAG technology, the development of embedding models has been in full swing. In addition to traditional models based on statistics and pre-trained models based on the encoder structure, embedding models fine-tuned on LLMs have also demonstrated powerful capabilities [39]. However, they often leading to weaker inference come with more parameters, and retrieval efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial to select the appropriate retriever based on different task scenarios. Sparse Retriever uses statistical methods to convert queries and documents into sparse vectors. Its advantage lies in its efficiency in handling large datasets, focusing only on non-zero elements. However, it may be less effective than dense vectors in capturing complex semantics. Common methods include TF-IDF and BM25.

Dense Retriever employs pre-trained language models (PLMs) to provide dense representations of queries and doc- uments. Despite higher computational and storage costs, it offers more complex semantic representations. Typical models include BERT structure PLMs, like ColBERT, and multi-task fine-tuned models like BGE [40] and GTE [41]."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|10a0fa1e03004e3fb6056378e005e784
"Hybrid Retriever is to use both sparse and dense retrievers simultaneously. Two embedding techniques complement each other to enhance retrieval effectiveness. Sparse retriever can provide initial screening results. Additionally, sparse models enhance the zero-shot retrieval capabilities of dense models, particularly in handling queries with rare entities, thereby increasing system robustness.

2) Retriever Fine-tuning: In cases where the context may diverge from pre-trained corpus, particularly in highly special- ized fields like healthcare, law, and other domains abundant in proprietary terminology. While this adjustment demands addi- tional effort, it can substantially enhance retrieval efficiency and domain alignment.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Fine-tuning a retrieval model based on labeled domain data is typically done using contrastive learning. This involves reducing the distance be- tween positive samples while increasing the distance between negative samples. The commonly used loss calculation is shown in the following:

times, fine-tuning a large retriever can be costly, especially when dealing with retrievers based on LLMs like gte-Qwen. In such cases, it can mitigate this by incorpo- rating an adapter module and conducting fine-tuning. Another benefit of adding an adapter is the ability to achieve better alignment with specific downstream tasks [42].

D. Post-retrieval

Feeding all retrieved chunks directly into the LLM is not an optimal choice. Post-processing the chunks can aid in better leveraging the contextual information. The primary challenges include: 1) Lost in the middle. Like humans, LLM tends to remember only the beginning or the end of long texts, while forgetting the middle portion [43]. 2) Noise/anti-fact chunks. Retrieved noisy or factually contradictory documents can impact the final retrieval generation [44]. 3) Context Window. Despite retrieving a substantial amount of relevant content, the limitation on the length of contextual information in large models prevents the inclusion of all this content."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|d7b6190896c74aa995e4aa263fa03810

2) ≥ . . . ≥ f (d′ k).

Rule-base rerank. Metrics are calculated to rerank chunks according to certain rules. Common metrics include: diversity, relevance and MRR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) [45]. The idea is to reduce redundancy and increase result diversity. MMR selects phrases for the final key phrase list based on a combined criterion of query relevance and information novelty. Model-base rerank. Utilize a language model to reorder the document chunks, commonly based on the relevance between the chunks and the query. Rerank models have become an important component of RAG systems, and relevant model technologies are also being iteratively upgraded. The scope reordering has also been extended to multimodal data such as tables and images [46].

2) Compression: A common misconception in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many relevant docu- ments as possible and concatenating them to form a lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive context can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s perception of key information. A common approach to address this is to compress and select the retrieved content. (13)

(Long)LLMLingua [47]. By utilizing aligned and trained small language models, such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA- 7B, the detection and removal of unimportant tokens from the prompt is achieved, transforming it into a form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but well understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct and practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the need for additional training of LLMs while balancing language integrity and compression ratio.

3) Selection: Unlike compressing the content of document

chunks, Selection directly removes irrelevant chunks.

Dq

s = fsel(Dq) = {di ∈ D | ¬P (di)}

Where fsel is the function for deletion operation and P (di) is a conditional predicate indicating that document (di) satisfies a certain condition. If document (di) satisfies (P (di)), it will be deleted. Conversely, documents for which (¬P (di)) is true will be retained."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|95c2a4eed2314061ba64cb6fa4ce28e6
"Selective Context. By identifying and removing redundant content in the input context, the input is refined, thus improv- ing the language model’s reasoning efficiency. In practice, se- lective context assesses the information content of lexical units based on the self-information computed by the base language model. By retaining content with higher self-information, this method offers a more concise and efficient textual representa- tion, without compromising their performance across diverse applications. However, it overlooks the interdependence be- tween compressed content and the alignment between the targeted language model and the small language model utilized for prompting compression [48].

LLM-Critique. Another straightforward and effective ap- proach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved content before generating the final answer. This allows the LLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM critique. For instance, in Chatlaw [49], the LLM is prompted to self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess their relevance.

E. Generation

Utilize the LLM to generate answers based on the user’s query and the retrieved contextual information. Select an appropriate model based on the task requirements, considering factors such as the need for fine-tuning, inference efficiency, and privacy protection."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|5c1692e517ae4b5bbbd71eaabf971341
"1) Generator Fine-tuning: In addition to direct LLM usage, targeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data character- istics can yield better results. This is also one of the greatest advantages of using an on-premise setup LLMs. Instruct-Tuning. When LLMs lack data in a specific do- main, additional knowledge can be provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. General fine-tuning dataset can also be used as an initial step. Another benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the model’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to adapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a particular style as instructed [50].

Reinforcement learning. Aligning LLM outputs with hu- man or retriever preferences through reinforcement learning is

a potential approach [51]. For instance, manually annotating the final generated answers and then providing feedback through reinforcement learning. In addition to aligning with human preferences, is also possible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models and retrievers.

Dual Fine-tuing Fine-tuning both generator and retriever simultaneously to align their preferences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the scoring functions between retriever and generator using KL divergence. Retrieval likeli- hood of each retrieved document d is calculated as :

2) Verification : Although RAG enhances the reliability of LLM-generated answers, in many scenarios, it requires to minimize the probability of hallucinations. Therefore, it can filter out responses that do not meet the required standards through additional verification module. Common verification methods include knowledge-base and model-base . (17)

Knowledge-base verification refers to directly validating the responses generated by LLMs through external knowledge. Generally, it extracts specific statements or triplets from re- sponse first. Then, relevant evidence is retrieved from verified knowledge base such as Wikipedia or specific knowledge graphs. Finally, each statement is incrementally compared with the evidence to determine whether the statement is supported, refuted, or if there is insufficient information [52]."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|b5b3e6b3244244b287d33071d985bc20
"Model-based verification refers to using a small language model to verify the responses generated by LLMs [53]. Given the input question, the retrieved knowledge, and the generated answer, a small language model is trained to de- termine whether the generated answer correctly reflects the retrieved knowledge. This process is framed as a multiple- choice question, where the verifier needs to judge whether the answer reflects correct answer . If the generated answer does not correctly reflect the retrieved knowledge, the answer can be iteratively regenerated until the verifier confirms that the answer is correct.

F. Orchestration

Orchestration pertains to the control modules that govern the RAG process. Unlike the traditional, rigid approach of a fixed process, RAG now incorporates decision-making at pivotal junctures and dynamically selects subsequent steps contingent upon the previous outcomes. This adaptive and modular ca- pability is a hallmark of modular RAG, distinguishing it from the more simplistic Naive and Advance RAG paradigm.

1) Routing: In response to diverse queries, the RAG system routes to specific pipelines tailored for different scenario, a feature essential for a versatile RAG architecture designed to handle a wide array of situations. A decision-making mechanism is necessary to ascertain which modules will be engaged, based on the input from the model or supplementary metadata. Different routes are employed for distinct prompts or components. This routing mechanism is executed through a function, denoted as fr(·), which assigns a score αi to each module. These scores dictate the selection of the active subset of modules. Mathematically, the routing function is represented as: where fr(·) maps the identified query to its corresponding RAG flow.

Metadata routing involves extracting key terms, or entities, from the query, applying a filtration process that uses these keywords and associated metadata within the chunks to refine the routing parameters. For a specific RAG flow, denoted as Fi, the pre-defined routing keywords are represented as the set Ki = {ki1, ki2, . . . , kin}. The keyword identified within the query qi is designated as K ′ i. The matching process for the query q is quantified by the key score equation:

scorekey(qi, Fj) =

1 |K ′ j|

|Ki ∩ K ′ j|"|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|a31a821db5334020864eae0f5fa2e2f0
"scorekey(qi, Fj) =

1 |K ′ j|

|Ki ∩ K ′ j|

This equation calculates the overlap between the pre-defined keywords and those identified in the query, normalized by the count of keywords in K ′ j. The final step is to determine the most relevant flow for the query q:

Fi(q) = argmaxFj ∈F score(q, Fj) Semantic routing routes to different modules based on the semantic information of the query. Given a pre-defined intent Θ = {θ1, θ2, . . . , θn}, the possibility of intent for query q is ePLM (θ|q) PΘ(θ|q) = θ∈Θ ePLM (θ|q)) . Routing to specific RAG flow is determined by the semantic score:

(cid:80)

socresemantic(q, Fj) = argmaxθj ∈ΘP (Θ)

The function δ(·) serves as a mapping function that assigns an intent to a distinct RAG flow Fi = δ(θi)

Hybrid Routing can be implemented to improve query routing by integrating both semantic analysis and metadata- based approaches, which can be defined as follows:

αi = a·scorekey(q, Fj)+(1−α)·maxθj ∈Θsocresemantic(q, Fj) (22) a is a weighting factor that balances the contribution of the key-based score and the semantic score."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|51bcf78b9ecc482b9ad7f06b65767f29
"2) Scheduling: The RAG system evolves in complexity and adaptability, with the ability to manage processes through a sophisticated scheduling module. The scheduling module plays a crucial role in the modular RAG , identifying critical junctures that require external data retrieval, assessing the adequacy of the responses, and deciding on the necessity for further investigation. It is commonly utilized in scenarios that involve recursive, iterative, and adaptive retrieval, ensuring

that the system makes informed decisions on when to cease generation or initiate a new retrieval loop.

Rule judge. The subsequent steps are dictated by a set of established rules. Typically, the system evaluates the quality of generated answers through scoring mechanisms. The decision to proceed or halt the process is contingent upon whether these scores surpass certain predetermined thresholds, often related to the confidence levels of individual tokens, which can be defined as follow:

yt =

(cid:40)

ˆst st = LM ([Dqt, x, y<t])

if all tokens of ˆst have probs ≥ τ

otherwise

Here, ˆst represents the tentative answer, and st is the output from the language model. The condition for accepting ˆst is that all tokens within it must have associated probabilities greater than or equal to the threshold τ . If this condition is not met, the system reverts to generating a new answer."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|8f8b87d35915422aa96ed36f427d3c73
LLM judge. The LLM independently determines the sub- sequent course of action. Two primary approaches facilitate this capability. The first method leverages LLM ’s in-context learning capability, and make judgments through prompt engineering. A significant advantage of this method is the elimination of model fine-tuning. Nonetheless, the format of the judgment output is contingent upon the LLM’s adherence to the provided instructions.|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|d8336abe19ba416987eece95b959f15c
The second approach involves the LLM generating specific tokens that initiate targeted actions through fine-tuning. This technique, with roots in the Toolformer [50], has been inte- grated into frameworks like Self-RAG [28]. This allows for a more direct control mechanism over the LLM’s actions, en- hancing the system’s responsiveness to specific triggers within the conversational context. However, it requires generating a large number of compliant instruction sets to fine-tune LLM. Knowledge-guide scheduling. Beyond the confines of rule- based methods and the complete reliance on LLMs for process control, a more adaptable intermediate approach emerges with knowledge-guided scheduling [26]. These methods harness the power of knowledge graphs, to steer the retrieval and generation processes. Specifically, it involves extracting infor- mation relevant to the question from a knowledge graph and constructing a reasoning chain. This reasoning chain consists of a series of logically interconnected nodes, each containing critical information for the problem-solving process. Based on the information from the nodes in this reasoning chain, information retrieval and content generation can be performed separately. By integrating this approach, it enhance not only the efficacy and precision of problem-solving but also the clarity of the explanations provided.|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|7f2e174e01c44a2db2cbb9928551824f
"3) Fusion: As RAG process has evolved beyond a linear pipeline, it frequently necessitates broadening the retrieval scope or enhancing diversity by exploring multiple pipelines. Consequently, after the expansion into various branches, the fusion module effectively integrates the information, ensuring a comprehensive and coherent response. The fusion module’s reliance is not just for merging answers but also for ensuring that the final output is both rich in content and reflective of the multifaceted nature of the inquiry.

LLM fusion.One of the most straightforward methods for multi-branch aggregation is to leverage the powerful capa- bilities of LLMs to analyze and integrate information from different branches. However, this approach also faces some challenges, particularly when dealing with long answers that exceeds the LLM’s context window limitation. To mitigate this issue, it is common practice to first summarize each branch’s answer, extracting the key information before inputting it into the LLM, thus ensuring that the most important content is retained even within length constraints.

is based on the weighted values of different tokens generated from multiple branches, leading to the comprehensive selection of the final output. This approach can be calculated as :

d∈Dq"|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|a0e57464340543d7bff50f400db685b3
"Weighted ensemble

p(y|q, Dq) =

(cid:88)

p(y|d, q) · λ(d, q)

The weight λ(d, q) is determined by the similarity score between the document d and the input query q. This weight is calculated using the softmax function, which ensures that the weights are normalized and sum up to one.

λ(d, q) =

(cid:80)

es(d,q) d∈Dq es(d,q)

RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) is an ensemble technique that synthesizes multiple retrieval result rankings into a co- hesive, unified list [54]. It employs a tailored weighted aver- aging approach to enhance collective predictive performance and ranking precision. The method’s strength is its dynamic weight assignment, which is informed by the interplay among branches. RRF is especially potent in scenarios characterized by model or source heterogeneity, where it can markedly amplify the accuracy of predictions.

V. RAG FLOW AND FLOW PATTERN

The collaboration between operators forms the workflow of the module, which we refer to as RAG flow F = (Mϕ1, . . . , Mϕn ), where ϕ stands for the set of module param- eters. A modular rag flow can be decomposed into a graph of sub-functions. Through control logic, the operators can execute in a predetermined pipeline, while also performing conditional, branching or looping when necessary. In the simplest case. the graph is a linear chain."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|034879f47e5c4a6fae12e5f365c452ce
"After conducting an in-depth analysis of current RAG meth- ods, we have identified a set of common RAG flow patterns, denoted as P. These patterns transcend various application domains and demonstrate a high level of consistency and reusability, revealing the prevalent structures and behaviors in process design. A RAG flow pattern can be defined as P = {Mϕ1 : {Op1} → Mϕ2 : {Op2} → . . . → Mϕn : {Opn}}

A. Linear Pattern

The modules in the modular RAG system are organized in

a linear way, and can be described as Algorithm 1.

Fig. 5. RRR [24] is a typical linear flow that introduces a learnable query rewrite module before retrieval. This module employs reinforcement based on the output results of the LLM.

The linear flow pattern is the simplest and most com- monly used pattern. As shown in Figure 4, the full linear RAG flow pattern mainly includes pre-retrieval processing, retrieval, post-retrieval processing, and generation modules. Plinearf ull = {Mindexing → Mpre-retrieval → Mretrieval → Mpost-retrieval → Mgenerate}. If there are no pre-retrieval and post-retrieval modules, it follows the Naive RAG paradigm.

Common linear RAG flow involves a query transform module (such as rewrite or HyDE operators) at the pre-retrieval stage and utilize rerank at the post-retrieval stage. Rewrite- Retrieve-Read (RRR) [24] is a typical linear structure. As illustrated in Figure 5, the query rewrite module frewrite is a smaller trainable language model fine-tuned on T5-large, and in the context of reinforcement learning, the optimization of the rewriter is formalized as a Markov decision process, with the final output of the LLM serving as the reward. The retriever utilizes a sparse encoding model, BM25.

B. Conditional Pattern

The RAG flow with conditional structure involves select- ing different RAG pipeline based on different conditions, as illustrated in Figure 6. A detailed definition is shown in Algorithm 2. Typically, pipleline selection is accomplished

Fig. 6. The conditional flow pattern. There is a routing module that controls which RAG flow the query is directed to.

Pipeline selection is determined by the nature of the ques- tion, directing different flows tailored to specific scenarios. For example, the tolerance for responses generated by LLMs varies across questions related to serious issues, political matters, or entertainment topics. These routing flow often diverge in terms of retrieval sources, retrieval processes, configurations, models, and prompts.

"C. Branching

In many cases, the RAG flow system may have multiple parallel running branches , usually to increase the diver- sity of generated results. Assuming multiple branches bi are generated in module B = Msplit(·) = {b1, b2, . . . , bm}. For each branch bi ∈ B, the same or different RAG pro- cesses can be executed, passing through multiple processing modules {M1, M2, . . . , Mk} to obtain branch output result pi = Mik(. . . Mi2(Mi1(bi)) . . .). The results of multiple branches are aggregated using an aggregation function to obtain intermediate output results. ˆO = Mmerge({pi | bi ∈ B}). However, aggregation is not necessarily the end of the RAG flow, as it can continue to connect to other modules, Mjn(. . . Mj2(Mj1( ˆO)) . . .). For example, after aggregating multiple model responses, they can continue through a val- idation module. Therefore, the entire branch flow pattern can be represented as:

Pbranch =Mjn(. . . Mj1(Mmerge({Mik

(. . . Mi1(bi) . . .) | bi ∈ Msplit(q)})) . . .)

The RAG flow with a branching structure differs from the conditional approach in that it involves multiple parallel

branches, as opposed to selecting one branch from multiple options in the conditional approach. Structurally, it can be categorized into two types, which are depicted in Figure 7 and Figure 8.

Pre-Retrieval Branching (Multi-Query, Parallel Retrieval). As shown in Algorithm 3, the process involves initially taking a query q and expanding it through a module Mexpand to gen- erate multiple sub-queries Q′. Each sub-query q′ i is then used to retrieve relevant documents via Mretrieve, forming document sets D′ i. These document sets, along with the corresponding sub-queries, are fed into a generation module Mgenerate to produce a set of answers Gi. Ultimately, all these generated answers are combined using a merging module Mmerge to form the final result y. This entire flow can be mathematically represented as:

Pbranchpre =Mmerge(q′

i∈Mexpand(q){Mgenerate(q′

i, d′

ij ∈ Mretrieve(q′ d′

i)})"|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|8ca0748cd3144876a5fbdb7f3ab8d291
"Pbranchpre =Mmerge(q′

i∈Mexpand(q){Mgenerate(q′

ij) |

ij ∈ Mretrieve(q′ d′

i)})

Post-Retrieval Branching (Single Query, Parallel Genera- tion). As shown in Algorithm 4, in the post-retrieval branching pattern, the process starts with a single query q which is used to retrieve multiple document chunks through a retrieval module Mretrieve, resulting in a set of documents Dq. Each document dq i from this set is then independently processed by a generation module Mgenerate to produce a set of generated results G. These results are subsequently merged using a merge module Mmerge to form the final result y. The process can be succinctly represented as y = Mmerge(Oi), where Oi is the collection of all generated results from each document dq i in Dq. Therefore, the entire process can be represented as:

Pbranchpost = Mmerge({Mgenerate(dq

i ) | dq

i ∈ Mretrieve(q)})

D. Loop Pattern

The RAG flow with a loop structure, as an important char- acteristic of Modular RAG, involves interdependent retrieval and generation steps. It typically includes a scheduling module for flow control. The modular RAG system can be abstracted as a directed graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices representing the various modules Mi in the system, and E is the set of edges representing the control flow or data flow be- tween modules. If there is a vertex sequence Mi1, Mi2, ..., Min such that Min can reach Mi1 (i.e., Min → Mi1), then this RAG system forms a loop. If Mj is the successor module of Mi and Mi decides whether to return to Mj or a previous module Mk through a Judge module, it can be represented Judge as: Mi −−−→ Mk where Mk is the predecessor module of Mj. If Mi return to Mj, it can be represented as: ∃Judge(Mi, Mj) (Mi, Mj) ∈ E and Judge(Mi, Mj) = true. If the Judge module not to return to any previous module, it can be represented as: ∀Mi ∈ Judge(Mi, Mj) = false for all Mj that are predecessors V, of Mi. Loop pattern can be further categorized into iterative, recursive, and adaptive (active) retrieval approaches.

Iterative retrieval At times, a single retrieval and genera- tion may not effectively address complex questions requiring extensive knowledge. Therefore, an iterative approach can be used in RAG (see Algorithm 5), typically involving a fixed number of iterations for retrieval. At step t, given the query qt and the previous output sequence y<t = [y0, . . . , yt−1] , iterations proceed under the condition that t is less than the maximum allowed iterations T . In each loop, it retrieves a document chunks Dt−1 using the last output yt−1 and the current query qt. Subsequently, a new output yt is generated. The continuation of the iteration is determined by a Judge module, which makes its decision based on the yt, y<t, qt, and the Dt−1.

ITER- RETGEN [56] (Figure 11), which iterates retrieval-augmented generation and generation-augmented retrieval. Retrieval- augmented generation outputs a response to a task input based on all retrieved knowledge. In each iteration, ITER-RETGEN leverages the model output from the previous iteration as a specific context to help retrieve more relevant knowledge.

A typical implementation of recursive retrieval, such as ToC [13] (see Figure 12 ), involves recursively executing RAC (Recursive Augmented Clarification) to gradually insert sub- nodes into the clarification tree from the initial ambiguous question (AQ). At each expansion step, paragraph re-ranking is performed based on the current query to generate a disam-

Once the clarification tree is constructed, ToC gathers all valid nodes and generates a comprehensive long-text answer to address AQ."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|bc535b16a78c4f2e849794c8984afe7b
"Adaptive (Active) retrieval With the advancement of RAG, there has been a gradual shift beyond passive retrieval to the emergence of adaptive retrieval (see Algorithm 7) , also known as active retrieval, which is partly attributed to the powerful capabilities of LLM. This shares a core concept with LLM Agent [57]. RAG systems can actively determine the timing of retrieval and decide when to conclude the entire process and produce the final result. Based on the criteria for judgment, this can be further categorized into Prompt-base and Tuning- base approaches.

"typical implementation example is FLARE [14]. Its core concept is that LLMs should only retrieve when essential knowledge is lacking, to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate retrieval in an enhanced LM. FLARE iteratively generates the next provisional sentence and checks for the presence of low- probability tokens. If found, the system retrieves relevant docu- ments and regenerates the sentence. Tuning-base. The tuning- based approach involves fine-tuning LLM to generate special tokens, thereby triggering retrieval or generation. This concept can be traced back to Toolformer [50], where the generation of specific content assists in invoking tools. In RAG systems, this approach is used to control both retrieval and generation steps. A typical case is Self-RAG [28](see Figure 14). Given an input prompt and the preceding generation result, first predict whether the special token Retrieve is helpful for enhancing the continued generation through retrieval. Then, if retrieval is needed, the model generates a critique token to evaluate the retrieved passage’s relevance. and a critique token to evaluate if the information in the response is supported by the retrieved passage. Finally, a critique token evaluates the overall utility of the response and selects the optimal result as the final output.

E. Tuning Pattern"|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|c05e9940dc42405fad69bb9a62f0c7b2
"E. Tuning Pattern

RAG is continuously integrating with more LLM-related technologies. In Modular RAG, many components are com- posed of trainable language models. Through fine-tuning, the performance of the components and the compatibility with the overall flow can be further optimized. This section will introduce three main patterns of fine-tuning stages, namely retriever fine-tuning, generator fine-tuning, and dual fine- tuning.

Fig. 15. Retriever fine-tuning pattern, mainly includes direct SFT, adding trainable adapter, LM-supervised retrieval and LLM Reward RL.

1) Retriever FT: In the RAG flow, common methods for fine-tuning the retriever is shown in Figure 15 ,which include: • Direct supervised fine-tuning of the retriever. Construct- ing a specialized dataset for retrieval and fine-tuning the dense retriever. For example, using open-source retrieval datasets or constructing one based on domain-specific data.

Adding trainable adapter modules. Sometimes, direct fine-tuning of the API-base embedding model (e.g., Ope- nAI Ada-002 and Cohere) is not feasible. Incorporating an adapter module can enhance the representation of your data. Additionally, the adapter module facilitates better alignment with downstream tasks, whether for task- specific (e.g., PRCA [42]) or general purposes (e.g., AAR [58]).

2) Generator FT: The primary methods for fine-tuning a generator in RAG flow is shown in Figure 16, which include: • Direct supervised fine-tuning. Fine-tuning through an external dataset can supplement the generator with ad- is the ability to ditional knowledge. Another benefit customize input and output formats. By setting the Q&A format, LLM can understand specific data formats and output according to instructions.

Distillation. When using on-premise deployment of open- source models, a simple and effective Optimization method is to use GPT-4 to batch construct fine-tuning data to enhance the capabilities of the open-source model. • RL from LLM/human feedback. Reinforcement learning based on feedback from the final generated answers. In addition to using human evaluations, powerful LLMs can also serve as an evaluative judge."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|eb52feb8555f4b8190f1075aecc45a8b
"In the RAG system, fine-tuning both the retriever and the generator simultaneously is a unique feature of the RAG system. It is important to note that the emphasis of system fine-tuning is on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. An exemplary implementation is RA-DIT [27], which fine-tunes both the LLM and the retriever. The LM-ft component updates the LLM to maximize the

VI. DISCUSSION

In this chapter, we explore the innovative horizons opened by the modular RAG paradigm. We examine its compatibility with cutting-edge methodologies in the progression of RAG technology, emphasizing its scalability. It not only fosters a fertile ground for model innovation but also paves the way for seamless adaptation to the dynamic requirements of various applications.

"A. Opportunities in Modular RAG

The benefits of Modular RAG are evident, providing a fresh and comprehensive perspective on existing RAG-related work. Through modular organization, relevant technologies and methods are clearly summarized.

From a research perspective. Modular RAG is highly scalable, it empowers researchers to introduce innovative mod- ules and operators, leveraging a deep understanding of RAG’s evolving landscape. This flexibility enables the exploration of new theoretical and practical dimensions in the field.

From an application perspective. The modularity of RAG systems simplifies their design and implementation. Users can tailor RAG flows to fit their specific data, use cases, and downstream tasks, enhancing the adaptability of the system to diverse requirements. Developers can draw from existing flow architectures and innovate by defining new flows and patterns that are tailored to various application contexts and domains. This approach not only streamlines the development process but also enriches the functionality and versatility of RAG applications.

B. Compatibility with new methods

Modular RAG paradigm demonstrates exceptional compati- bility with new developments. To gain a deeper understanding

of this, we list three typical scalability cases, which clearly shows that Modular RAG paradigm provides robust support and flexibility for the innovation and development of RAG technology."|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|fde2095aed274c6486b98eaf9c8bc95e
1) Recombination of the current modules: In this scenario, no new modules or operators are proposed; rather, specific problems are addressed through the combination of existing modules.DR-RAG [59] employs a two-stage retrieval strategy and classifier selection mechanism, incorporating a branching retrieval structure. In the first stage, retrieving chunks relevant to the query. In the second stage, the query is combined individually with each chunk retrieved in the first stage, and a parallel secondary retrieval is conducted. The retrieved content is then input into a classifier to filter out the most relevant dynamic documents. This ensures that the retrieved documents are highly relevant to the query while reducing redundant information. DR-RAG improved retrieval method significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of answers, bolstering RAG’s performance in multi-hop question-answering scenar- ios.|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|41c75302d755405f8062a2488d76be15
2) New flow without adding new operators.: This refers to redesigning the processes for retrieval and generation to address more complex scenarios without proposing new mod- ules. The core idea of PlanRAG [18] lies in its introduction of a preliminary planning stage, a crucial step that occurs before retrieval and generation. Initially, the system employs a judge module to assess whether the current context necessitates the formulation of a new plan or adjustments to an existing one. When encountering a problem for the first time, the system initiates the planning process, while in subsequent interactions, it decides whether to execute re-planning based on previous plans and retrieved data. Next, the system devises an execution plan tailored to the query, treating this process as a logical decomposition of complex queries. Specifically, PlanRAG uses a query expan- sion module to extend and refine the query. For each derived sub-query, the system conducts targeted retrieval. Following retrieval, another judge module evaluates the current results to decide whether further retrieval is required or if it should return to the planning stage for re-planning. Through this strategy, PlanRAG is able to handle complex decision-making problems that require multi-step data analysis more efficiently.|research_papers\Modular_RAG_Transforming_RAG_Systems_into_LEGO-lik.pdf|97791ad6ae5749b7b5f668d0d4ca016b
"3) New flow derived from new operators.: New operators often introduce novel flow design, exemplified by Multi-Head RAG [60]. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require retrieving multiple documents with significantly different content. Such queries are common but difficult to handle because embeddings of these documents may be far apart in the embedding space. Multi-Head RAG addresses this by designing a new retriever that uses the activations of the multi-head attention layers of the Transformer, rather than the decoder layers, as keys for retrieving multifaceted documents. Different attention heads can learn to capture different aspects of the data. By using the corresponding activation results, embeddings that represent different aspects of the data items and the query can be generated, thereby enhancing the retrieval accuracy for complex queries.

VII. CONCLUSION

RAG is emerging as a pivotal technology for LLM applica- tions. As technological landscapes evolve and the intricacies of application requirements escalate, RAG systems are being en- hanced by integrating a diverse suite of technologies, thereby achieving a higher level of complexity and functionality. This paper introduces the innovative paradigm of Modular RAG. This approach systematically disassembles the complex archi- tecture of RAG systems into well-defined, discrete functional modules. Each module is meticulously characterized by its specific operational functions, ensuring clarity and precision. Therefore, the entire system is composed of those modules and operators, akin to Lego bricks. By conducting an in- depth analysis of numerous studies, the paper also distills common RAG design patterns and scrutinizes key case studies to illustrate these patterns in practice.

Modular RAG not only offers a structured framework for the design and application of RAG systems but also en- ables a scenario-based customization of these systems. The modularity inherent in this design facilitates ease of tracking and debugging, significantly enhancing the maintainability and scalability of RAG systems. Furthermore, Modular RAG opens up new avenues for the future progression of RAG technology. It encourages the innovation of novel functional modules and the crafting of innovative workflows, thereby driving forward the frontiers of RAG systems.

Abstract"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|6900f0342cf04051b154bbb867e54ac6
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aug- ments large language models (LLM) by re- trieving relevant knowledge, showing promis- ing potential in mitigating LLM hallucinations and enhancing response quality, thereby facil- itating the great adoption of LLMs in prac- tice. However, we find that existing RAG sys- tems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi- hop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi- hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of building the dataset, utiliz- ing an English news article dataset as the un- derlying RAG knowledge base. We demon- strate the benchmarking utility of MultiHop- RAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different embedding models for re- trieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we examine the capabili- ties of various state-of-the-art LLMs, includ- ing GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in rea- soning and answering multi-hop queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that ex- isting RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable re- source for the community in developing effec- tive RAG systems,|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|f7284119ef2e4ab5838546c8d0a8a6f0

Introduction

nAI, 2023). One promising use case is Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) (Asai et al., 2023), which optimizes the output of a large language model by referencing an external knowledge base outside of the LLM training data sources before generating a response. RAG improves LLM’s re- sponse (Borgeaud et al., 2022) and also mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, thereby enhancing the models’ credibility (Gao et al., 2023). LLM- based frameworks, such as LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022) and LangChain (Chase, 2022), specialize in sup- porting RAG pipelines."|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|01d829147f8e4c5ea4b305e918665f1e
"In real-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, a user’s query often necessi- tates retrieving and reasoning over evidence from multiple documents, a process known as multi-hop query. For instance, consider financial analysis us- ing a database of financial reports. A financial ana- lyst might query, Which company among Google, Apple, and Nvidia reported the largest profit mar- gins in their third-quarter reports for 2023? or inquire about a specific company’s performance over time, such as How does Apple’s sales trend look over the past three years? These queries re- quire evidence from multiple documents to formu- late an answer. Due to the multifaceted nature of such queries, involving information from various sources, traditional similarity matching methods like cosine similarity between query and financial

"report chunk embeddings might not yield optimal results. We demonstrate this multi-hop retrieval process in Figure 1.

However, existing RAG benchmarks, such as RGB (Chen et al., 2023) and RECALL (Liu et al., 2023), mainly evaluate a simple case where the an- swer of a query can be retrieved and solved using one single piece of evidence. None of these bench- marks assess the retrieval and reasoning capability of LLMs for complex multi-hop queries. To ad- dress this gap and make RAG benchmarking more closely resemble real-world scenarios, in this paper, we introduce MultiHop-RAG. To our knowledge, MultiHop-RAG is one of the first RAG datasets focusing specifically on multi-hop queries.

Based on the RAG queries commonly encoun- tered in real-world scenarios, we first categorize multi-hop queries into four types: Inference query, Comparison query, Temporal query, and Null query. The first three types — Inference, Com- parison, and Temporal — require the retrieval and analysis of evidence from multiple sources, encom- passing tasks like inferring relationships, compar- ing data points, and sequencing events over time. The Null query represents a scenario where the query cannot be derived from the knowledge base. This category is crucial for assessing whether an LLM might hallucinate an answer to a multi-hop query when the retrieved text lacks relevance."|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|290175bb6b4640548d74f1e16af0a145
"We construct our RAG knowledge base using a collection of news articles. Using GPT-4 as a data generator, we then take an extensive procedure to construct a diverse set of multi-hop queries, each requiring the retrieval and reasoning over multiple documents. An example of query construction is shown in Table 1. First, we begin by extracting

factual sentences from each news article as evi- dence. For example, an extracted piece of evidence from an article may state: “Back then, just like today, home prices had boomed for years before Fed officials were ultimately forced to hike interest rates aggressively in an attempt to fight inflation.” Second, we input each evidence piece into GPT-4, prompting it to rephrase the evidence into a claim. This claim is clarified with a disambiguated topic and entity. For instance, GPT-4 might rephrase the aforementioned evidence into: “Federal Reserve officials were forced to aggressively hike interest rates to combat inflation after years of booming home prices”, identifying “Interest rate hikes to combat inflation” as the topic and “Federal Re- serve” as the entity. These topics and entities act as bridges for constructing multi-hop queries, known as bridge-topic or bridge-entity. Next, we use GPT- 4 to generate specific multi-hop queries related to the same bridge-topic or bridge-entity, accompa- nied by the correct answers. Lastly, we undertake a validation step to ensure the data quality."|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|e6b82a7a458148108f254deb6eae0172
"We demonstrate the benchmarking capabilities of MultiHop-RAG using two experiments, utilizing a RAG system implemented with LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022). The first experiment involves a comparison of different embedding models for retrieving rele- vant evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we assess the reasoning and answering abilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM, Claude-2, Llama2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B, for multi-hop queries when re- trieved text is provided. The results from both ex- periments indicate that the current RAG implemen- tations are inadequate for effectively retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We publicly release

this challenging MultiHop-RAG dataset and hope it will be a valuable resource for the community in de- veloping and benchmarking RAG systems, thereby unleashing the great potential of generative AI in practice.

"2 RAG with multi-Hop queries

2.1 Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)

In an RAG application, we utilize an external cor- pus, denoted as D, which comprises multiple docu- ments and serves as the knowledge base. Each doc- ument within this corpus, represented as di ∈ D, is segmented into a set of chunks.These chunks are then transformed into vector representations using an embedding model and stored in an embedding database. Given a user query q, the system typi- cally retrieves the top-K chunks that best match the query. These chunks constitute the retrieval set for query q, represented as Rq = {r1, r2, ..., rK}. The retrieved chunks, combined with the query and an optional prompt, are then fed into an LLM to generate a final answer, following the format: LLM(q, Rq, prompt) → answer.

2.2 Multi-Hop Query"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|e6c013f9ca3347a1a932125cd030482c
"2.2 Multi-Hop Query

We define a multi-hop query as one that requires retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence to provide an answer. In other words, for a multi-hop query q, the chunks in the retrieval set Rq collectively provide an answer to q. For example, the query ""Which company among Google, Apple, and Nvidia reported the largest profit margins in their third-quarter reports for 2023?"" requires 1) retrieving relevant pieces of evidence related to profit margins from the reports of the three companies; 2) generating an answer by comparing and reasoning from the multiple pieces of retrieved evidence. This differs from a single- hop query such as ""What is Google’s profit margin in the third-quarter reports for 2023,"" where the answer can be directly derived from a single piece of evidence.

Based on the queries commonly used in real- world RAG systems, we identify four types of multi-hop queries. For each type, we present a hypothetical query within the context of a financial RAG system, where the knowledge base consists of a collection of annual reports. Inference query: For such a query q, the answer is deduced through reasoning from the retrieval set Rq. An example of an inference query might"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|58bab00914ae4a5e838c235da119649f
"be: Which report discusses the supply chain risk of Apple, the 2019 annual report or the 2020 annual report? Comparison query: For such a query q, the an- swer requires a comparison of evidence within the retrieval set Rq. For instance, a comparison query might ask: Did Netflix or Google report higher revenue for the year 2023?"" Temporal query: For such a query q, the answer requires an analysis of the temporal information of the retrieved chunks. For example, a temporal query may ask: Did Apple introduce the AirTag tracking device before or after the launch of the 5th generation iPad Pro? Null query: For such as query q, the answer cannot be derived from the retrieved set Rq. We include the null query to assess the generation quality, es- pecially regarding the issue of hallucination. For a null query, even though a retrieved set is provided, an LLM should produce a null response instead of hallucinating an answer. For example, assum- ing ABCD is a non-existent company, a null query might ask: What are the sales of company ABCD as reported in its 2022 and 2023 annual reports?

2.3 Evaluation Metrics

An RAG system handling multi-hop queries can be assessed from two key aspects: retrieval evaluation and generation evaluation."|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|f9032686d5ab459ebbf05c67b72deefd
"An RAG system handling multi-hop queries can be assessed from two key aspects: retrieval evaluation and generation evaluation.

Retrieval Evaluation: Evidently, the quality of the retrieval set Rq determines the final genera- tion quality. We compare the retrieved set with the ground truth evidence associated with each query, except for the null queries, as they have no evidence to derive from. Assuming the top- K chunks are retrieved, i.e., |Rq| = K, we use retrieval evaluation metrics including Mean Aver- age Precision at K (MAP@K), Mean Reciprocal Rank at K (MRR@K), and Hit Rate at K (Hit@K). MAP@K measures the average top-K retrieval pre- cision across all queries. MRR@K calculates the average of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant chunk for each query, considering the top-K re- trieved set. Hit@K metric measures the fraction of evidence that appears in the top-K retrieved set.

Response Evaluation: Since the multi-hop query requires reasoning over multiple pieces of retrieved chunks, we can also evaluate the reason- ing capability of the LLM by comparing the LLM response with the ground truth answer of the query.

3 A Benchmarking Dataset:

MultiHop-RAG

In this section, we provide detailed information on the construction of the MultiHop-RAG dataset. Specifically, we describe the process of creating a set of multi-hop queries, along with the correspond- ing ground truth evidence sets and answers derived from a collection of news articles.

3.1 MultiHop-RAG Construction

Step 1: Dataset Collection. We download a news dataset using the mediastack API 1, a REST API in- terface delivering worldwide news data. The news data source comprises various English-language websites covering a range of news categories: en- tertainment, business, sports, technology, health, and science. To mimic real-world RAG scenarios, where the knowledge base data, such as an enter- prise’s internal data, may differ from the LLMs’ training data, we select news articles published from September 26, 2023, to December 26, 2023. This timeframe extends beyond the knowledge cut- off of some widely-used LLMs, including Chat- GPT and LLaMA, as of the time of writing. This selection also helps in teasing out the possibility of the underlying LLM having been exposed to these news articles. We only keep articles with a token length greater than or equal to 1,024. Every

news article is paired with metadata, including the title, publish date, author, category, URL, and news source. Step 2: Evidence Extraction. For each article, we extract factual or opinion sentences using a trained language model 2. These factual sentences are later used as evidence for answering multi-hop queries. We retain only those news articles containing ev- idence that may have overlapping keywords with other news articles. This allows us to later create multi-hop queries where the answer’s evidences are drawn from multiple sources. Step 3: Claim, Bridge-Entity, Bridge-Topic Gen- eration. Our goal is to use GPT-4 to automatically generate high-quality multi-hop queries using the evidence set. However, the raw evidence obtained from Step 2 is not ideal for query generation due to inconsistency in linguistic structure. For exam- ple, some pieces of evidence use pronouns to refer to subjects and lack the actual entity in the text. To address this, we employ GPT-4 to paraphrase the evidence, which we refer to as claims, given the original evidence and its context. To ensure consistency between the generated claim and the evidence, we further perform fact-checking using the UniEval (Zhong et al., 2022) framework to ver- ify the alignment between the evidence and claim. Appendix A presents the prompt used for GPT-4 for claim generation. Bridge-Entity and Bridge-Topic: The shared en- tity or topic across pieces of evidence is referred to as the bridge-entity or|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|4c13a9d858af49d28fda145a0863df59
for claim generation. Bridge-Entity and Bridge-Topic: The shared en- tity or topic across pieces of evidence is referred to as the bridge-entity or bridge-topic. These bridge- entities or bridge-topics can be used to link dif- ferent pieces of evidence from which a multi-hop query’s answer is derived. For example, in a claim such as “Google reports its third-quarter results for 2023, showcasing a detailed overview of its finan- cial performance, including revenue growth, profit margins”, the term profit margin can be viewed as a bridge-topic and the term Google can be viewed as a bridge-entity that links the different pieces of evidence. We prompt GPT-4 to identify the bridge- entity and bridge-topic for each claim. Appendix A also presents the prompt used for GPT-4 for bridge generation. Step 4: Query and Answer Generation. In this step, we leverage the bridge-entity or bridge-topic to generate multi-hop queries. Specifically, we first group the claims having the same bridge-entity or|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|7aad2cc3288044c680fec912e2512620

el

bridge-topic into a claim set. We restrict the claim set to have at least two claims but no more than four claims. For each type of query, we feed the claim set to GPT-4 and prompt it with an instruction to generate a query with information from each claim. Below, we explain the specifications for different multi-hop query types. In the construction of each query, we also include the source of the news article where the supporting evidence is associated with to mimic real-world RAG scenarios. Appendix A presents the prompts used for GPT-4 for query generation.

Inference Query: These queries are formulated by synthesizing the various characterizations of the bridge-entity across multiple claims, with the final answer being the identification of the entity itself. Comparison Query: These queries are struc- tured to compare the similarities and differences related to the bridge entity or topic. The resultant answer to such queries is typically a definitive “yes” or “no”, based on the comparison.

Temporal Query: These queries explore the temporal ordering of events across different points in time. The answer to such queries is typically a “yes” or “no” or a single temporal indicator word like “before” or “after”."|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|610399c77883478da2ac3cf3d88d2c11
"Null Query: Null query is a query whose an- swer cannot be derived from the retrieved set. To create null queries, we generate multi-hop queries using entities that do not exist in the existing bridge- entities. To add complexity, we also include fic- tional news source metadata when formulating these questions, ensuring that the questions do not reference any contextually relevant content from the knowledge base. The answer to the null query should be “insufficient information” or similar. Step 5: Quality Assurance. Finally, we use two approaches to reassure the dataset quality. First, we manually review a subset sample of the generated multi-hop queries, their corresponding evidence sets, and the final answers. The results of the man- ual examination indicate a high degree of accuracy and data quality. Second, we utilize GPT-4 to as- sess each example in the dataset against the follow- ing criteria: 1) The generated query must utilize all provided evidence in formulating the response; 2) The query should be answerable solely based on the provided evidence; 3) The response to the generated query should be either a single word or a specific entity; 4) The query must conform to its designated query type.

The MultiHop-RAG dataset contains six different types of news articles, covering 609 distinct news, with an average of 2,046 tokens. The distribution of the news categories is shown in Table 2. MultiHop- RAG contains four types of multi-hop queries and the distribution of these queries is shown in Table 3. In total, about 88% of queries in the dataset are non-null queries where answers can be retrieved and reasoned from the knowledge base. In addition, the form of queries exhibits considerable diversity. Approximately 27% of interrogative queries start with ""does,"" around 15% initiate with ""what,"" a similar proportion start ""which,"" and 14% begin with ""who,"" with the remainder incorporating a small percentage of other interrogative words such as ""when."" Moreover, the number of evidence re- quired to answer a multi-hop query varies. Table 4 shows the distribution of evidence numbers for each query in the dataset. Around 42% of queries can be answered using two pieces of evidence, while approximately 30% and 15% of queries can be answered using three or four pieces of evidence, respectively."|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|2485b4580d5242068fdb931d7d833ff3

related tasks can be categorized as retrieval-related tasks and generation-related tasks. A retrieval- related task focuses on retrieving relevant text from the knowledge base, while a generation-related task focuses on generating high-quality responses given the retrieved text. In this section, we showcase two use cases for each task where MultiHop-RAG can be employed.

"4.1 Retrieval-related Task

An important design choice in an RAG system is the selection of the embedding model. An embed- ding model converts data into numerical vectors and subsequently stores these vectors in embedding databases. In this experiment, we evaluate differ- ent embedding models by examining their retrieval quality. Experiment Setup: We implement an RAG sys- tem using the LlamaIndex framework (Liu, 2022). We partition the documents in the MultiHop-RAG knowledge base into chunks, each consisting of 256 tokens. We then convert the chunks using an em- bedding model and save the embeddings into a vec- tor database. Similarly, in the retrieval step, we con- vert a query using the same embedding model and retrieve the top-K most relevant chunks that have the highest cosine similarity with the query embed- ding. In this experiment, we test a variety set of em- bedding models, including the ada-embeddings by OpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002, text-search-ada- query-001), voyage-02 3, llm-embedder (Zhang et al., 2023), bge-large-en-v1.5 (Xiao et al., 2023), jina-embeddings-v2-base-en (Günther et al., 2023), e5-base-v2 (Wang et al., 2022), and instructor-large (Su et al., 2023). NULL queries are excluded in this experiment because there is no matching evi- dence to the query. Additionally, we also include a Reranker module to examine the retrieval perfor- mance, using bge-reranker-large (Xiao et al., 2023). After retrieving 20 related chunks using the em-"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|752ff37b3d0545249f6356447f9d7836

bedding model, we further select the top-K chunks using the Reranker. Experiment Result: Table 5 shows the retrieval result of using different embedding models. It shows that there is still a significant gap in retriev- ing relevant evidence for the multi-hop queries. While Rerank can effectively improve retrieval rel- evance, the highest Hits@10 is only 0.7467 when the Reranker technique is used. Moreover, the drop in the highest Hits@4 to 0.6625 is worrisome. In practical RAG systems, the underlying LLM of- ten has a context window limit. As a result, the number of retrieved chunks is usually restricted to a small number. The low values of the retrieval metrics highlight the challenges in retrieving rele- vant pieces of evidence for multi-hop queries when using direct similarity matching between the multi- hop query and text chunks.

4.2 Generation-related Task"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|7b0925671e644e68848ae6768a14f153
The underlying LLMs play a crucial role in gen- erating responses in an RAG system. In this ex- periment, we evaluate the quality of generated re- sponses under two different settings. In the first setting, we employ the best-performing retrieval model, namely voyage-02 with bge-reranker-large, as indicated in Table 5, to retrieve the top-K texts and then feed them into the LLM. In the second setting, we use the ground-truth evidence associ- ated with each query as the retrieved text for the LLM. This setting represents a ceiling performance for testing the LLM’s response capabilities, as it utilizes the actual evidences. Experiment Setup: In the first experiment, we retrieve top-6 chunks so that the total length of the retrieved text does not exceed 2,048. All queries in MultiHop-RAG are tested in the experiment. In the second experiment, since the null queries do not have associated evidence, we exclude this type of query in the experiment. For the LLMs used in the experiment, we consider state-of-the- art commercial models, including GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-3.5, Claude-2 (Anthropic, 2023), and Google-PaLM (Google, 2023). We obtain answers using the provided API of the respective models. We also assess some open-source models, includ- ing Mixtral-8x7b-instruct (Jiang et al., 2024) and Llama-2-70b-chat-hf (Touvron et al., 2023). Experiment Results: Table 6 shows the response accuracy of different LLMs. First, we can see that the response accuracy rate using the retrieved|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|ae364b5bc8d340149c31dc807975e410

This is expected, because the retrieval component falls short in retrieving relevant evidences from the knowledge base. Second, even when we provide the LLM with the ground-truth evidences, we can see that the response accuracy is far from being per- fect. Open source LLM such as Llama02-70B and Mixtral-8x7B only achieve an accuracy of 0.32 and 0.36 respectively. GPT-4 achieves strong reason- ing capability with an accuracy of 0.89, followed by the second-based LLM Google-PaLM with an accuracy of 0.74.

Taken together, this experiment demon- strates that there is still room for improvement in the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly those that are open-source, for multi-hop queries."|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|6af665fefda2411fb7f52dbc31a89d66
"Figure 3 shows the detailed results of different query types for GPT-4 and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct. Both models show relatively high robustness on null queries, meaning they are generally good at determining when a query cannot be answered based on the retrieved text. This is encouraging be- cause one benefit of RAG is to mitigating the LLM hallucination issue by augmenting LLM with re- trieval knowledge. However, Mixtral-8x7B model performs significantly worse than the GPT-4 in comparison and temporal queries. Upon reviewing the incorrect responses, we find that Mixtral-8x7B fails to accurately handle logical negation, leading to misinterpretation of statements and thus a low performance in the comparison queries. In addi- tion, Mixtral-8x7B often fails to correctly identify

4.3 Other Use Cases

Beyond embedding models and LLM generation, there are other areas worth exploring. For exam- ple, query decomposition is a widely utilized tech- nique in RAG frameworks, such as LLamaIndex. This process involves breaking down the query into smaller segments; it targets a single document for retrieval and integrates the information subse- quently, thereby potentially enhancing retrieval ac- curacy. Another advanced and promising approach involves building LLM-based agents that can au- tomatically plan and execute multi-hop queries, such as AutoGPT (Gravitas, 2023). Another area of interest is the hybrid retrieval approach, which combines keyword and embedding matching tech-"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|6985e982dd6545cead3258079cc6680f
"niques. We believe that there are many potential areas for enhancing RAG’s performance on multi- hop queries, and the curated dataset MultiHop- RAG can be a valuable resource to the community.

RAG Evaluation: As RAG systems gain increas- ing popularity, a variety of RAG benchmarking datasets and evaluation tools have been developed. For instance, RGB (Chen et al., 2023) and RE- CALL (Liu et al., 2023) evaluate the performance of LLMs in generating responses for RAG systems under conditions involving noisy, integrative, and counterfactual queries. However, both datasets pri- marily focus on evaluating the generation aspect of RAG systems without specifically addressing their retrieval accuracy. In addition, recent ad- vancements have been made in automated RAG evaluation tools, such as ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2023) and RAGAS (Es et al., 2023). These tools utilize LLMs to automatically assess the quality of RAG generation, yet they do not introduce bench- marking datasets. Our work introduces one of the first RAG benchmarking datasets, consisting of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associ- ated supporting evidence, thereby complementing existing RAG evaluations. Retrieval datasets: Apart from the context of RAG, several benchmarking datasets exist for in- formation retrieval evaluation. The FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) dataset, for instance, contains claims classified as Supported, Refuted, or NotEnoughInfo by the given Wikipedia article (Thorne et al., 2018). Similarly, the SciFact dataset comprises scientific claims paired with evidence- containing abstracts (Wadden et al., 2020). How-|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|c2a0a5574f724e07853c8eceb23ec680
et al., 2018). Similarly, the SciFact dataset comprises scientific claims paired with evidence- containing abstracts (Wadden et al., 2020). How- ever, the claims in both datasets are single-hop statements, and the supporting evidence is from one single article, in contrast to the multi-hop queries discussed in this paper. Another dataset, HoVer, involves claims that require extracting and reason- ing from multiple Wikipedia articles (Jiang et al., 2020). However, unlike our dataset, HoVer focuses solely on classifying claims as either supported or not supported by the articles without evaluating an LLM generation step. Moreover, in HoVer, the Wikipedia articles from which evidence is drawn are given for claim verification, which is signifi- cantly different from our setting, where relevant pieces of evidence need to be extracted from a|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|54fd0efc0813414cb824b7e55104e4af
"large knowledge base. Separately, (Kamalloo et al., 2023) evaluates a range of commercial embedding APIs for information retrieval, but this evaluation is not contextualized within the framework of RAG systems either. Multi-document QA datasets: Question- answering (QA) is a fundamental task in NLP, and several popular benchmarks, such as HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MultiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018), and 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), aim to achieve QA from multiple sources of documents. This task is similar to our multi-hop query RAG task, as both involve reasoning from multiple sources of information. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing a model’s reasoning skills, and they do not emphasize the retrieval of evidence from a knowledge base. Additionally, their primary data sources Wikipedia, significantly overlap with the training data of most existing LLMs. If we use these sources for benchmarking RAG systems, there is a potential concern that LLM responses might rely on training knowledge rather than reasoning from the retrieved knowledge base.

6 Conclusion"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|263098ada69347e1911922e5c49ec204
"6 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce MultiHop-RAG, a novel and unique dataset designed for queries that re- quire retrieval and reasoning from multiple pieces of supporting evidence. These types of multi-hop queries represent user queries commonly encoun- tered in real-world scenarios. MultiHop-RAG con- sists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. This paper details the creation process of MultiHop-RAG, em- ploying a hybrid approach that integrates human effort with GPT-4. Additionally, we explore two use cases of MultiHop-RAG in the benchmarking of RAG systems, thereby highlighting the potential applications of this dataset. By publicly releas- ing MultiHop-RAG, we aim to provide a valuable resource to the community, contributing to the ad- vancement and benchmarking of RAG systems.

Limitations

This work has several limitations that can be im- proved in future research. First, our ground truth answers are restricted to simple responses such as “yes"", “no"", entity names, or temporal indicators like “before"" or “after"" to facilitate the use of a"|research_papers\MultiHop-RAG_Benchmarking_Retrieval-Augmented_Gene.pdf|e61dd173b32a431d9c190d77bfac15b3
"straightforward accuracy metric for evaluating gen- eration performance. Future work could consider allowing free text as answers and employing more sophisticated metrics to assess generation quality. Second, the current dataset limits supporting ev- idence for a query to a maximum of four pieces. Future work can extend the dataset by including queries that require retrieving and reasoning from even more evidence. Lastly, while our experiments utilize a basic RAG framework using LlamaIndex, future work could involve evaluating the answering of multi-hop queries using more advanced RAG frameworks or LLM-agent frameworks.

OBSERVATIONS ON BUILDING RAG SYSTEMS FOR TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS

Sumit Soman and Sujoy Roychowdhury∗ {sumit.soman, sujoy.roychowdhury}@ericsson.com

ABSTRACT

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for technical documents creates chal- lenges as embeddings do not often capture domain information. We review prior art for important factors affecting RAG and perform experiments to highlight best practices and potential challenges to build RAG systems for technical documents.

1

INTRODUCTION

Long form Question Answering (QA) involves generating paragraph-size responses from Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs). RAG for technical documents has several challenges Xu et al. (2023); Toro et al. (2023). Factors affecting retrieval performance, including in-context documents, LLMs and metrics, have been evaluated Chen et al. (2023a). To further build on this work, we conduct exper- iments on technical documents with telecom and battery terminology to examine the influence of chunk length, keyword-based search and ranks (sequence) of retrieved results in the RAG pipeline.

Our experiments are based on IEEE Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications IEEE (2021) and IEEE Standard Glossary of Stationary Battery Ter- minology 1881-2016 (2016). We separately process the glossary of definitions and the full docu- ment, as many expected questions are based on the definitions.We source questions based on domain knowledge and report experimental results on 42 representative queries across the documents. Mul- tiple embedding models can be used, Reimers & Gurevych (2019), we use MPNET Song et al. (2020) for the entire document - excluding tables and captions. For the glossary, we split the term and the definition and generate separate embeddings for them, as well as for the full paragraph hav- ing the defined term and the definition. Soman & HG (2023) have reviewed other LLMs for telecom domain, but we chose llama2-7b-chat model Touvron et al. (2023) as it is free and has a commercial- friendly license. We evaluate on multiple questions and report on selected questions to substantiate our observations. For reference, the prompts used for the LLM are provided in Appendix A.

3 OBSERVATIONS"|research_papers\Observations_on_Building_RAG_Systems_for_Technical.pdf|a4c32137915b459383c9a9c762656f98
"3 OBSERVATIONS

We first observe that sentence embeddings become unreliable with increasing chunk size. Appendix B Fig. 1 shows the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot of cosine similarity scores for various sentence lengths. We take 10,970 sentences and look at pairwise similarity for all the sentences. A high similarity is observed when the length of the sentences is relatively long. The higher similarity distribution for larger lengths indicates spurious similarities which we manually validate for a few samples. We find that when both the query and queried document are over 200 words, the similarity distribution is bimodal. When either of them are over 200 words, there is a small but less perceptible lift at higher similarities.

Table 1 summarizes our hypotheses and key observations - corresponding sample queries and their results are provided in Appendix C. We hypothesize that splitting on definition and terms can help improve results (H1), similarity scores being a good measure (H2), position of keywords influenc- ing results (H3), sentence-based similarity resulting in a better retriever (H4) and generator (H5),

answers for definitions based on acronyms (H6) and effect of order of retrieved results on generator performance (H7). Of these, H2 is a result of our experiments with distributions of similarity scores referred earlier and H7 is based on Chen et al. (2023a). Others are derived from our experiments to improve results. For each hypotheses, we provide the number of experiments that support the claim and those that are valid for the same in the last column, along with sample queries.

We find that retrieval by thresholding on similarity scores is not helpful. For queries 1, 2 and 5, when the query phrase is present in the term or definition, top retrieved score is higher. For query 3, the correct result is retrieved at the second position using definition embedding, but in other cases, result is not retrieved and similarity scores are close. For queries 4 and 6, we are unable to retrieve the correct result, though scores indicate otherwise. Thus, thresholding retriever results based on similarity scores can potentially result in sub-optimal generator augmentation. We evaluate generator performance on our queries based on the retrieved results. This is done using the top k retrieved (a) definitions, and (b) terms and definitions. Better context gives better generated responses. For acronyms and their expansions, the generator does not add any additional value."|research_papers\Observations_on_Building_RAG_Systems_for_Technical.pdf|b69451c3e9e548868144ed1c6a8fca23
"For retrieval on the full document, we explore similarity search by sentence and paragraph sepa- rately. In the former, we retrieve the paragraph to which the sentence belongs and take top-k distinct paragraphs from top similar sentences. We observe that the results by sentence-based similarity search and paragraphs being used for generator provides better retriever and generator performance. Authors in Chen et al. (2023a) mention order of presented information to be important, but we did not observe different results on permuting the retrieved paragraphs. We observe generator responses to sometimes fail due to incorrect retrieval, hallucinated facts or incorrect synthesis as highlighted in Chen et al. (2023a). We recommend such approaches for definition QA and long form QA.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

We show that chunk length affects retriever embeddings, and generator augmentation by threshold- ing retriever results on similarity scores can be unreliable. However, use of abbreviations and a large number of related paragraphs for a topic make our observations particularly relevant for long form QA on technical documents. As future work, we would like to use RAG metrics Es et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023b) to choose retrieval strategies. Also, methods and evaluation metrics to answer follow-up questions would be of interest.

ABSTRACT

We propose a natural language prompt-based retrieval augmented generation (Prompt-RAG), a novel approach to enhance the performance of generative large language models (LLMs) in niche domains. Conventional RAG methods mostly require vector embeddings, yet the suitability of generic LLM- based embedding representations for specialized domains remains uncertain. To explore and exemplify this point, we compared vector embeddings from Korean Medicine (KM) and Conventional Medicine (CM) documents, finding that KM document embeddings correlated more with token overlaps and less with human-assessed document relatedness, in contrast to CM embeddings. Prompt-RAG, distinct from conventional RAG models, operates without the need for embedding vectors. Its performance was assessed through a Question-Answering (QA) chatbot application, where responses were evaluated for relevance, readability, and informativeness. The results showed that Prompt-RAG outperformed existing models, including ChatGPT and conventional vector embedding-based RAGs, in terms of relevance and informativeness. Despite challenges like content structuring and response latency, the advancements in LLMs are expected to encourage the use of Prompt-RAG, making it a promising tool for other domains in need of RAG methods.

1. Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models combine a generative model with an information retrieval function, designed to overcome the inherent constraints of generative models.(1) They integrate the robustness of a large language model (LLM) with the relevance and up-to-dateness of external information sources, resulting in responses that are not only natural and human-like but also the latest, accurate, and contextually relevant to the query.(1-4) The interaction of the two modules (retrieval and generation) enables responses that would not be achievable with either module alone, making RAG more than just the sum of its components. This approach represents a significant milestone in the field of generative models by enabling the induction of high-quality responses in less-explored domains at a low expense.(5, 6)"|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|ab0eba18da2040198ad83f3126995862
In the conventional RAG operation, the initial step involves converting input queries into vector embeddings, which are then used to retrieve relevant data from the vectorized database. Following this, the generative part of RAG utilizes the retrieved external data for producing contextually rich responses.(7) Thus, both the embedding and generative models are considered crucial factors in the performance of RAG, directly affecting the retrieval process.(8) However, in niche domains, the performance of generic LLM-based embedding models appears suboptimal compared to their effectiveness in more general fields. The lack of specialized training data in these domains results in embeddings that do not adequately capture the nuances and specificity of the domain(9), leading to less accurate and contextually relevant information retrieval. Despite the evident presence of these functional limitations, they have not been much identified through experiments, therefore the optimality of the conventional LLM-based vector embedding RAG methods for niche domains has remained in obscurity. Researchers have been aware of these shortcomings of LLMs and have explored supplementary processes such as fine-tuning to improve the performance.(8, 10-12) However, the cost of fine-tuning, especially when it involves adjusting the entire or majority of parameters in LLM, has rapidly become expensive, thereby increasing the demand for alternative solutions.(13-15)|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|72ba8a45ae8c48078b7e0ca1636f2b00
"To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology: Prompt-RAG. This new approach to RAG eliminates the reliance on vector embeddings, adopting a more direct and flexible retrieval process based on natural language prompts. It involves a large-scale pre-trained generative model that handles the entire steps from document retrieval to response generation without the need for a vector database or an algorithm for indexing and selecting vectors, thus having the processing structure of RAG greatly simplified. Therefore, it not only takes advantage of the RAG’s strength but also circumvents the limitations of conventional vector embedding-based methodology. Prompt-RAG is based on maximizing the use of the advanced natural language processing capabilities of LLMs. Especially using the latest GPT model, our method can compensate for the deficiencies in vector embedding-based RAG arising from the shortage of domain-specific knowledge.

To examine the utility of Prompt-RAG in practice, we conducted two exemplary studies focusing on the Korean Medicine (KM) domain. KM, a branch of traditional East Asian medicine, has diverged from traditional Chinese medicine and Japanese Kampo medicine in aspects like physiological theories, treatments, and Sasang constitutional medicine.(16, 17) It was reported that GPT models have achieved excellent results in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)(18-20), while

ChatGPT’s scores on the Korean National Licensing Examination for Korean Medicine Doctors barely reached the passing threshold, underperforming in subjects unique to KM, especially Sasang constitutional medicine and public health & medicine-related law.(21) In this niche area, rich in specialized knowledge and distinct from Conventional Medicine (CM), we first demonstrated the functional suboptimality of LLM-based vector embeddings. Subsequently, we demonstrated Prompt- RAG's effectiveness in this context. A Question-Answering (QA) chatbot based on Prompt-RAG was built using KM-specific documents, and our model’s performance was compared with that of ChatGPT and conventional vector embedding-based RAG models. This study not only highlights the challenges of conventional RAG methods in niche domains but also showcases the potential of Prompt-RAG as a more effective alternative.

2. Design of Prompt-RAG

In this study, we introduce Prompt-RAG, a novel approach distinct from the conventional vector embedding-based RAG. Prompt-RAG consists of three steps: preprocessing, heading selection, and retrieval-augmented generation. The overall scheme of Prompt-RAG might seem similar to that of conventional RAG methods. However, details in each step are quite distinguishable especially in that conventional RAGs rely on a complex multi-step process involving the vectorization of documents and algorithmic retrieval from a vector database for a generative model's response. The workflows of vector embedding-based RAG and our method are depicted in Figure 1.

Figure. 1. Comparative workflows of two RAG models. (A) depicts the vector embedding-based RAG process. Relevant pieces of information are retrieved from a database of document embeddings through algorithms. The retrieved data are augmented in a generative model to produce a response. (B) illustrates the process of Prompt-RAG. An LLM-based generative model directly uses a table of contents for constructing a contextual reference, followed by generating a response with it. Abbreviation: RAG, Retrieval-augmented generation; LLM, Large-language model.

1) Preprocessing"|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|d20bc6ddf57b420f85c6cd3a2e4ab9eb
"1) Preprocessing

Prompt-RAG initiates by extracting or creating a Table of Contents (ToC) from a user’s document(s), which is the main subject of the retrieval. The procedure can be done flexibly depending on the type of document and the user's preferences. One of the most ideal cases is that a ToC is already prepared, made by the author(s) of the document. And yet, even in the absence of a pre-determined ToC, it can be arbitrarily generated, for example, using a generative model or in a manual way, based on the document's quantitative, semantic, or individual divisions. It should be noted that the size of a ToC must not exceed the context window size of the generative model for heading selection. Consequently, some headings or details of the ToC (e.g., heading or page numbers, or hierarchical structure) might need to be removed in order to reduce the number of tokens. The body of the document should then be divided

4

into sections according to the headings and prepared for subsequent retrieval.

2) Heading selection"|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|c6fb22f89d80420f907fd95915895946
"4

into sections according to the headings and prepared for subsequent retrieval.

2) Heading selection

A prompt, which contains both a query and a ToC, is passed to an LLM-based generative model and the model is asked to autonomously select the headings most pertinent to the query or those that help the most to find information concerning the query. Multiple heading selections can be performed using the hierarchical structure of the headings, narrowing down from main headings to subheadings if a user wants to make use of all the headings from an oversized ToC. As this procedure is a preliminary step for making a reference for answer generation, the number of selected headings can be set in the prompt in advance depending on the budget and the context window size of the generative model for answer generation. It is recommended that the model produce a response in a structured format during heading selection to optimize efficiency for the following retrieval process as well as token usage.

3) Retrieval-augmented generation"|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|a8c6406955374bd0b384cf90e32a7736
"3) Retrieval-augmented generation

Sections of the document under the selected headings are retrieved and concatenated as a reference for answer generation. Again, it should be noted that the size of a reference must be smaller than the context window size of the generative model for answer generation. Therefore, the size of a reference has to be reduced by truncation or summarization when overly large. After a reference is prepared, a prompt including both the query and the reference is forwarded into a generative model. In response, the model consults the augmentations to generate a response to the query.

3. Experiments 1) Comparative exploration of LLM-based vector embeddings in the KM and CM domains. This experiment aimed to identify and exemplify the relative representational defects of LLM-based vector embedding in niche domains compared to other well-established domains. To explain this point, we conducted a comparative analysis with vector embeddings from documents in KM and CM domains. For this experiment, we selected 10 documents each from KM and CM domains, specifically regarding their physiological contents. ‘Eastern Medicine Physiology'(22) served as the document pool for KM. This book, compiled in Korean, has been revised by professors from every Korean Medicine college in South Korea and is used as the principal textbook in the physiology curriculum. On the other hand, ‘Physiology'(23) was chosen for the CM domain. To investigate the impact of language on representational differences in embeddings, we collected documents with the exactly identical contents from both the English version and the Korean-translated version of ‘Physiology'. The titles of the selected documents from each domain are listed in Appendix Table 1. We extracted the embedding vectors for a total of 30 documents – 10 each from KM physiology, CM physiology in Korean (CM_KR), and CM physiology in English (CM_EN) – using E5-mistral-7b-instruct(24), Voyage AI’s voyage-02, and OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 models to figure out LLMs' representations of KM and CM knowledge."|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|5574dfc210bd4b2892e23d2677a964a9
"Our analysis focused on identifying patterns of the KM and the CM domain embeddings with three key document similarity metrics: human-evaluated document relatedness, embedding correlation coefficients, and token overlap coefficients. We assessed whether the correlation coefficients between embedding pairs closely align with the human-evaluated ground truth or merely follow the surface- level similarity (token overlap) by conducting the correlation analyses across these metrics. It allows us to understand the depth of embedding representations and their correlation with human-perceived document pairwise relevance.

For this, the Pearson correlation coefficients(25) were calculated for every embedding vector pair, covering 45 pairs in each of the three categories (KM, CM_KR, CM_EN). To assess explicit similarity in a document pair, we computed the overlap coefficient(26) for tokens in KM, CM_KR, CM_EN documents. The token overlap coefficient was calculated as:

𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝 𝑐𝑜𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡(cid:3002),(cid:3003) =

| A ∩ B | min(|𝐴|, |𝐵|)

| A ∩ B |: The count of token co-occurrence between documents A and B. min(|𝐴|, |𝐵|): The minimum token count in either document A or B."|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|e16d0e735eb446d0bc52e920f2d35192
"| A ∩ B |: The count of token co-occurrence between documents A and B. min(|𝐴|, |𝐵|): The minimum token count in either document A or B.

Token overlap coefficients were calculated three times with different tokenizers corresponding to the embedding models: E5-mistral-7b-instruct(24), Voyage AI’s voyage-02, and OpenAI's text-embedding- ada-002. Repeated appearances of a single token in a document were counted and considered separately. To determine the ground truth of document pair correlations within each domain, two KM doctors with national licenses evaluated the relatedness between each pair of the KM and CM documents. A binary scoring system was adopted: a score of 1 indicated that a pair was interrelated, and 0 for unrelated

6

documents. The human-evaluated document relatedness scores were then obtained by averaging the two doctors' scores in KM and CM documents, respectively.

The correlation analyses were conducted between human-evaluated document relatedness scores and embedding correlation coefficients, and between embedding correlation coefficients and token overlap coefficients with Scipy(27) in Python 3.11. Bonferroni correction(28) was applied for p-values due to the multiple comparisons.

"2) Performance comparison of Prompt-RAG and existing models (1) Chatbot Settings

For the evaluation, we developed a domain-specific, prompt-RAG-based chatbot for the book 'Introduction to Current Korean Medicine’(29). The chatbot employed GPT architectures: GPT-4-0613 for the heading selection and GPT-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 for the answer generation.

The original ToC of the book had already been defined by the authors. Subheadings were added to it, aligning with the book’s actual sections. The expanded table of contents exceeded the context window size for heading selection, so some headings were removed to handle this issue. The body of the book was then segmented according to the modified headings for the subsequent retrieval.

We passed a model based on GPT-4 a prompt containing both the revised ToC and a query, asking the model to identify five pertinent headings from the ToC. At the same time, it was instructed to avoid selecting a heading if the query was about greetings or casual talks. The prompt for heading selection is shown in Table 1.

Upon selecting the headings, the corresponding book sections were fetched and concatenated. In turn, this was provided as a reference in a prompt along with the query to another generative model based on GPT-3.5-turbo-16k. This model was required to generate an answer with the prompt which also contained a directive to refrain from saying nonsense when no relevant context was found in the reference thereby aiming to minimize hallucination. In cases where the selected headings are absent due to the query being a greeting or casual conversation, an alternative prompt without a reference section is passed to a GPT-3.5-turbo-based model, in order to reduce token usage and save on expenses. The prompts for answer generation are depicted in Table 2.

"generation, within each context window limit. We employed Langchain(30) for the processes above.

(2) Baselines

① ChatGPT

For the first baseline to compare the performance of our model with, we utilized ChatGPT without any retrieval-augmentation process. ChatGPT is based on a diverse, large-scale corpus, equipped with an immense range of global knowledge.(31) Therefore, we evaluated our model's proficiency in generating answers specific to the domain of KM, in contrast with general knowledge of ChatGPT. This baseline included employing both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models of ChatGPT (chatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, respectively).

② Chunk retrievals

As our second baseline, we adopted vector embedding-based chunk retrieval. The text of the book was divided into chunks of size 50 and 100, respectively, using Tiktoken(32). Subsequently, each chunk was vectorized through OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002. Vectors that most closely matched the query

9

embedding by maximal marginal relevance(33) were retrieved. The number of retrieved vectors was set to 300 for chunk size 50 (C50-V300) and 150 for chunk size 100 (C100-V150), respectively, to make the most of the context window of GPT-3.5-turbo-16k for answer generation.

(3) Tasks and performance evaluation metrics

To evaluate the performance of our domain-specific, prompt-RAG-based chatbot and the other baseline models, we composed a series of 30 questions related to KM. The models were to generate answers to those questions in order."|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|26f3e060129443d08a42665976f98d5b
"Each question was categorized into one of the three types to examine the models’ capabilities in direct retrieval, comprehensive understanding, and functional robustness. The questions among the three types followed a ratio of 4:4:2. For the ChatGPT baselines, which do not utilize retrieval augmentation, questions specifically inquiring about the author’s perspective were appropriately adjusted. Further details on the questions and their types are provided in Appendix Table 2.

Human evaluation was performed for the generated answers by three KM doctors. The evaluators assessed the models’ answers in terms of three criteria: relevance, readability, and informativeness.(34, 35) Relevance measured how well the answer directly addressed the central topic of the question. Readability evaluated the naturalness and fluency of the answer. Informativeness assessed the depth and significance of the answer's content. Each question was scored in terms of every criterion with either 0, 1, or 2 points. In the evaluation process, each response started with a base score of 2 for each criterion, and evaluators were instructed to deduct points based on the presence of specific flaws. Descriptions for the criteria and the scoring system are provided in Table 3. The Response time taken to generate each answer was also measured for the comparison of our model and chunk retrieval models

models—E5-mistral-7b-instruct, voyage-02, and text-embedding-ada-002—the correlation coefficients for CM were consistently higher than those for KM, indicating a stronger alignment with human judgment in the context of CM. Within CM, the coefficients for CM_EN were higher than those for CM_KR. Specifically, for the E5-mistral-7b-instruct model, the Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.503 for KM, while it increased for CM_KR to 0.691 and was highest for CM_EN at 0.725. Similarly, voyage-02 presented a negative correlation for KM (-0.016), but it showed positive correlations of 0.376 for CM_KR and a notably stronger 0.670 for CM_EN. The text-embedding-ada-002 model demonstrated a coefficient of 0.167 for KM, with higher values of 0.563 for CM_KR and 0.625 for CM_EN. Notably, CM_EN exhibited statistically significant positive correlations across all models (0.725, 0.670, and 0.625, respectively), indicating a robust positive correlation in the context of CM and English compared to KM and Korean. In contrast, the correlations in KM were either weak or slightly negative (-0.016 and 0.167), with the exception of the E5-mistral-7b-instruct model, which yielded a moderate 0.503."|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|a93c3036f6cc4477ad98cefbe015c33d
"Secondly, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the embedding correlation coefficients and token overlap coefficients showed varied patterns. In CM_EN, the E5-mistral-7b-instruct model had a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.438, and voyage-02 had a coefficient of 0.518, both indicating moderate positive correlations. However, these correlations, including the one for text-embedding-ada- 002, were all lower than those observed for human-evaluated document relatedness. For KM, significant positive correlations were observed in voyage-02 and text-embedding-ada-002, with coefficients of 0.429 and 0.501, respectively. These values are in stark contrast to the previously discussed Spearman's correlations between human-evaluated document relatedness scores and embedding correlation coefficients for KM (-0.016 and 0.167, respectively). This suggests that these models may prioritize token-level features of documents over their human-perceived meanings when generating vector representations. These findings are summarized in Table 4.

Overall, embedding correlations in CM_EN consistently demonstrates a higher alignment with human-evaluated document relatedness compared to KM and CM_KR. On the contrary, the embedding representation of KM tends to be determined by the explicit lexical similarity from token overlaps. These findings illustrate insufficiencies of LLM-based vector embeddings in capturing human- perceived conceptual meanings in niche domains, suggesting that their application in conventional RAG systems may result in suboptimal performances.

Firstly, we compared the performance of our prompt-RAG model with that of ChatGPT to examine its proficiency in the KM domain. Prompt-RAG achieved mean scores of 1.956 for relevance and 1.589 for informativeness, respectively, surpassing ChatGPT-3.5 (1.711 for relevance, 0.667 for informativeness) and ChatGPT-4 (1.833 for relevance, 1.033 for informativeness). It is noteworthy that our model's informativeness scores were significantly higher, being more than double those of ChatGPT-3.5 and exceeding those of ChatGPT-4 by over 1.5 times. In terms of readability, our model scored 1.900, which was about equal to ChatGPT-3.5's score (1.900) and slightly lower than ChatGPT- 4’s (1.922). Overall, our model demonstrated its outperformance against ChatGPT baselines, especially GPT-3.5, in generating domain-specific answers related to KM."|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|bdd66c68ef894781a7fe52fdc62affea
"Further, we explored whether the prompt-RAG approach could produce better answers than the conventional chunk retrieval method. For all the criteria, our model scored higher than C50-V300 and C100-V150. The readability scores of our model were significantly higher compared to C100-V150, and especially for informativeness, our model obtained statistically significant scores, approximately

15

2.5 times that of C50-V300 and around 1.9 times that of C100-V150. However, our mode was significantly slower in terms of average response time, taking an additional 18.356 seconds compared to C50-V300 and 17.806 seconds more than C100-V150. These results find that the Prompt-RAG model excelled in answer quality, while the latency in answer generation was larger than the chunk retrieval method.

(2) Comparison by types of questions

To assess the overall quality and applicability of our prompt-RAG, we conducted a comparative analysis of its performance against the other models across different question types: direct retrieval, comprehensive understanding, and functional robustness. The summed scores for relevance, readability, and informativeness by the three evaluators were averaged for each question and each question type, respectively. The results by the question types are illustrated in Figure 4."|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|b0555f08970d4db9aa55104081b0c9ac

5. Discussion"|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|d7508457d42a4c369a68505c0be2bf6f
In this study, our exploration of LLM-based vector embeddings revealed marked limitations within the KM domain. The analysis showed that vector embeddings are heavily influenced by languages and token overlaps, which are not always compatible with human reasoning, potentially leading to suboptimal performance when used in RAG methods. To address these shortcomings, we introduced Prompt-RAG, a natural language prompt-based RAG methodology, providing a strategic shift from conventional RAGs operated with vector embeddings. This stemmed from the recognition of the limitations inherent in LLMs, utilizing the linguistic capabilities of LLM and addressing its constraints at the same time. As a result, our QA chatbot equipped with Prompt-RAG exhibited promising outcomes in terms of relevance, readability, and informativeness in the KM domain. Moreover, it coped with a variety of types of KM-related questions as well, proving its practical stability. The potential of Prompt-RAG is substantial. Importantly, our model is not confined only to the KM domain but can be applied to other marginal domains that require RAG. GPT is recognized for its emergent properties, potentially helping deal with highly abstract, contextual, or previously unseen expressions.(37-39) It would facilitate high-quality retrieval with a ToC that contains the comprehensive and essential context of documents, leading to desirable responses across various domains. Its applicability and efficiency can expand|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|4f8fa0d888ad4c20ba3b18d3585c383a
comprehensive and essential context of documents, leading to desirable responses across various domains. Its applicability and efficiency can expand vastly, together with natural language processing techniques developing and improving. As the cognitive abilities of LLMs continue to advance, we look forward to Prompt-RAG becoming an even more powerful tool with full reliance on the capabilities of an LLM itself. Its wide-ranging adaptability derived from the ability to understand and process unacquainted or uncertain concepts and terminologies would raise some challenges for conventional vector embedding- based RAG. For example, a short query has been known to undermine the performance vector embedding-based informational retrieval due to the lack of contexts, even though it is the major form of a search query on the internet.(40-42) The adoption of the natural language prompts through GPT allows for a nuanced understanding of queries(43) and thus results in a more detailed, accurate, and relevant retrieval. In addition, Prompt-RAG can be much more efficient when it comes to model updates, saving on the expense and time for the renewal of document embeddings, especially with larger documents. These properties would be highlighted in dynamic environments in terms of data with its ability to be applied without the need for repetitive retraining or embedding.|research_papers\Prompt-RAG_Pioneering_Vector_Embedding-Free_Retrie.pdf|ef1334ac905b428982ab9f412c5b8652
"However, we acknowledge that Prompt-RAG has certain limitations. Firstly, the requirement for a ToC might sometimes pose an obstacle, depending on the type or structure of the document. Secondly, the recurring latency and expenses associated with running a generative model or making Application Programming Interface (API) calls for heading selection do result in longer response times and higher costs. However, these issues are expected to naturally improve as the generative performance of LLMs continues to develop and model pricing plans become more economical, as has been the trend. Explorations and developments in model compression and light-weight artificial intelligence technologies for resource-constrained devices have been recently encouraged by the popularization of individual edge devices.(44-46) This trend seems to be extending to natural language processing domains as well(47), which would help solve the latency issue of our model. The rapid advancements

18

in generative models suggest that the limitations of our model will become increasingly less problematic in the foreseeable future, likely sooner than anticipated.

6. Conclusion

We suggest Prompt-RAG as an alternative to the conventional vector embedding RAG methods, addressing the limitations of LLM-based vector embeddings in niche domains where inconsistencies with human reasoning can lead to suboptimal performance. With its derived QA chatbot, Prompt-RAG has achieved notable outcomes as demonstrated by our study on KM, showing its potential as a versatile and effective tool in line with the rapidly evolving LLM field. While there is room for improvement, its practical benefits are expected to grow through internal and external development. Providing a new paradigm in RAG, it contributes to the advancement of information retrieval in specific domains with remarkable ease.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a standard architectural pat- tern for incorporating domain-specific knowledge into user-facing chat applica- tions powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG systems are charac- terized by (1) a document retriever that queries a domain-specific corpus for context information relevant to an input query, and (2) an LLM that generates a response based on the provided query and context. However, comprehen- sive evaluation of RAG systems remains a challenge due to the lack of unified evaluation criteria and annotated datasets. In response, we introduce RAGBench: the first comprehensive, large-scale RAG benchmark dataset of 100k examples. It covers five unique industry-specific domains and various RAG task types. RAGBench examples are sourced from industry corpora such as user manuals, making it particularly relevant for industry applications. Further, we formalize the TRACe evaluation framework: a set of explainable and actionable RAG evalua- tion metrics applicable across all RAG domains. We release the labeled dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rungalileo/ragbench. RAGBench explainable labels facilitate holistic evaluation of RAG systems, enabling action- able feedback for continuous improvement of production applications.

Introduction

Despite remarkable reasoning and conversational abilities, out-of-the-box pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reason about out-of-domain, knowledge-intensive queries [21, 14]. In response, Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems [21, 20] are becoming increasingly popular in user-facing dialogue applications [35]. Generally, RAG systems comprise a retriever component that queries relevant documents from an in-domain corpus and a downstream LLM generator model that incorporates the retrieved documents along with the original user query to output an informed response. The additional context helps ground the LLM in factual information and has been shown to boost performance on knowledge-intensive tasks [21].

Still, when used in production settings, RAG systems are prone to hallucinations as the generator model struggles to retrieve relevant information from the context [1, 31, 7]. In the absence of a one-fits-all approach, application-specific RAG systems must be fine-tuned for optimal performance on domain-specific tasks. However, the choice of retriever and generator models for each application is complex and has serious implications on overall system quality and costs. With numerous

commercial and open-source generative LLMs readily available1 and many variable parameters in the RAG system design (Figure 1), tuning an optimal system for a particular RAG application involves iterative evaluation of multiple configurations. This motivates the need for automated RAG evaluation solutions."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|40f9c56a8e0d4b818c5514e91b240c89
In response, automated RAG evaluation systems like RAGAS [9] and TruLens [37] have emerged. These systems adopt a zero-shot LLM prompt-based approach to predict a set of curated RAG evaluation metrics. However, the lack of unified RAG benchmarks makes it difficult to compare approaches against each other. Each new study designs a new dataset, often employing LLMs as generators and labelers [9, 33, 4], which renders them irreproducible. A few benchmarks like RGB [4], AttributionBench [22] and RAGTruth [41] have been proposed recently, but they are small in size and target a disjoint set of labels. The exact RAG evaluation criteria also vary from study to study. ARES [33] and RAGAS [9] define a context relevance metric to evaluate the quality of the retrieved documents, along with answer relevance and faithfulness to evaluate the quality of the generative model. However, others have explored other metrics like correctness [1] noise rejection and robustness [4], to name a few. Finally, most studies evaluate on small in-domain evaluation datasets that are specific to each new application [33, 34, 9, 1, 4], leaving cross-domain generalization an open question.|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|6f3497b9f4e744a7a64f6b83a52296c3
"In this work we propose RAGBench: a comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking RAG evaluation models. RAGBench comprises data sourced from multiple domains along with a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics. Specifically, we adopt existing metric definitions for context relevance, answer faithfulness [9, 33] and introduce two new metrics: context utilization and answer completeness. We argue that this new suite of metrics better describes the overall RAG system performance, with the potential to provide granular, actionable insights to the RAG practitioner.

We evaluate state-of-the art LLMs and existing RAG evaluation systems on RAGBench. We find that, while few-shot LLM judges perform equally well across domains and task types, they still under-perform compared to a fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model. We motivate future work to leverage these data for advancing RAG evaluation approaches and improve on the proposed benchmark.

2 Related Work

RAG benchmarks Numerous general LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as ChatbotArena [46] have been proposed in past work. However, human preference datasets, constructed through pairwise comparisons, have limitations. While these data are appropriate for fine-tuning general purpose LLM judges, they are insufficient for building RAG evaluation systems because preference judgements under-represent important RAG dimensions like factuality and completeness of the response [13]."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|e4742775e87448eb97c1723eb8048f0c
"CHATRAGBENCH [24] is a recent initiative that is similar in intent to our work in that it contributes a large-scale unified RAG benchmark. However, CHATRAGBENCH only contains ground truth responses and lacks the granular component-specific labels that we release with RAGBench. As future work, we can consider annotating CHATRAGBENCH with the schema proposed in this paper, to further scale RAGBench.

RAGTruth [41] is another recent effort at a RAG Benchmark. RAGTruth combines QA, Data-toText, and Summarization RAG data with human annotated hallucinated spans in the response. While it is an excellent benchmark for hallucination detection, it does not offer the level of granularity we present with RAGBench that is necessary to understand the RAG system as a whole."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|40f4cb5195f34f0a91b9299243274acc
"RAG evaluation Recently, several parallel efforts have proposed approaches to automated RAG evaluation. In RAGAS [9], the authors query an LLM-judge (GPT-3.5) with a curated prompt to evaluate context relevance, answer relevance and faithfulness of a RAG response. Next, Saad-Falcon et al. [33] propose ARES, a framework for fine-tuning smaller NLI models to predict the same metrics. This approach benefits from fine-tuning, though domain-specific annotated validation sets are required for each domain adaptation. In parallel, Chen et al. [4] develop a heuristic system to probe LLM’s robustness to noisy and irrelevant context documents, and Adlakha et al. [1] explore heuristic algorithms to estimate RAG correctness and faithfulness.

Finetuned RAG evaluation models Fine-tuned LLM judges are another a common way to ap- proach the LLM evaluation task [17, 44, 41]. A number of studies also leverage small, fine-tuned Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for RAG hallucination detection [2, 22, 33]. NLI models measure the degree of entailment between a premise and a hypothesis, which has been successfully repurposed for evaluating LLM response attribution in RAG setting. In this work, we train and evalu- ate an NLI model for RAG evaluation using RAGBench. The fine-tuned model not only outperforms LLM judges in hallucination/attribution detection but also excels on the new RAG evaluation metrics we propose.

"3 RAGBench Construction

3.1 Component Datasets

RAGBench is a collection of real-world datasets that span different domains and RAG task types. We source data from open-book Question-Answer (QA) datasets (CovidQA [27], PubmedQA [15], HotpotQA [42], MS Marco [29], CUAD [12], EManual [28], TechQA [3], FinQA [5], TAT-QA [47], ExpertQA [26], HAGRID [16]), as well one that was specifically adapted for RAG (DelucionQA [34]). We transform all 12 component datasets to a standardized RAG format with consistent annotations. To best represent real-world RAG scenarios, we vary a number parameters to construct the benchmark: the source domain, number of context documents, context token length, and the response generator model Figure 1 illustrates where these variable parameters fall in the RAG pipeline.

Source Domains RAGBench comprises five distinct domains: bio-medical research (PubmedQA, CovidQA), general knowledge (HotpotQA, MS Marco, HAGRID, ExperQA), legal contracts (CuAD), customer support (DelucionQA, EManual, TechQA), and finance (FinBench, TAT-QA). We select these specific domains based on availability of data, and applicability to real-world RAG applications across different industry verticals. For detailed descriptions of each component data source, refer to Appendix 9.2."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|896d30a1e7c043acba87de34d8660b66
"Context Token Length Context token length in RAGBench ranges from 100 to 11k tokens, which we report in Table 1. Notably, CUAD documents feature long contexts of up to 11k tokens each, compared to the relatively short context in PubMedQA.

Task Types We curate RAGBench to inlcude a variety of difficult RAG task types. Customer support datasets simulate a common application of RAG in industry settings. FinQA and TAT-QA require numerical reasoning over hybrid tabular and text data. HotpotQA, CovidQA, and PubMedQA

necessitate retrieval and reasoning over multiple context docs. The CUAD dataset is a challenging addition to RAGBench for several reasons: (i) it represents a difficult and highly-specialized real- world domain in which of-the-shelf pre-trained LLM models struggle to perform well [25], and (ii) it is equally challenging in RAG context due to very long context lengths of legal contract documents.

Question Sources All component datasets include domain-specific questions that represent real- world user queries about various topics. Questions for DelucionQA, HotpotQA, and EManual are crowd-sourced; questions for CovidQA, CUAD, HAGRID, ExpertQA, and FinQA are composed by domain experts; MS Marco is sourced from real-world user web search queries; likewise, TechQA questions are user queries posted on IBM technical forums; PubMedQA is the only dataset with automatically-generated questions from research article titles."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|2fad0a6715c64a8f8ec30248f7dc38fc
"Response Generation For each component dataset we generate responses with LLMs. Exceptions to this are HAGRID and ExpertQA datasets, which contain LLM-generated responses in the original data. To introduce variability into the dataset, we generate two responses per input with different modes: GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-0125) and Claude 3 Haiku. Both are proprietary models that are offered at a reasonable price point2, which we believe make them suitable candidates for generating real-world RAG responses. For CUAD we only generate responses with Claude 3 Haiku due to prohibitively long context lengths that exceed the GPT-3.5 16k token limit. To encourage a diverse distribution of labels in RAGBench, we use a basic prompt (Appendix 9.3) that does not explicitly require the model to stick to the provided context when generating the response. We set the temperature to 1.0 for generation.

Data Splits We split each component dataset into train, validation, and test sets, ensuring there is no overlap in queries across splits from the same data source. RAGBench totals 100k samples, split across train, validation, and test sets. Component dataset statistics are reported in Table 1.

RAGBench Statistics RAGBench component datasets contain between 1% - 20% hallucinations. ExpertQA, CovidQA, and MS Marco contain the highest fraction of hallucinated responses (12%, 16%, and 13%, respectively), while Cuad, FinQA, and TAT-QA contain the least (about 1% for each). We visualize distributions of relevance, utilization, and completeness scores in Figure 2.

3.2 TRACe Evaluation Framework

We propose a suite of four comprehensive metrics to evaluate the quality of the retriever and the response generator components of RAG. An optimal RAG system must balance accuracy and efficiency. The retriever should precisely return all the necessary information to address the user query, avoiding any superfluous data. The generator must effectively utilize the retrieved information, ensuring the response is strictly based on the provided context without introducing any hallucinations in the output."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|58cc422ebf424c978720f4eec96a4a2e
"Towards comprehensive evaluation of the abovementioned criteria, we introduce the TRACe evalua- tion framework to measure uTilization, Relevance, Adherence, and Completeness of a RAG system. Utilization, Adherence, and Completeness measure the quality of the generator. Adherence here is synonymous with previously proposed answer faithfullness, groundednes, and attribution, all terms used in literature to measure how well an LLM output adheres to a source of factual information. Relevance measures the quality of the retriever output with respect to the query. Below we formalize the definition of each metric.

Definitions Let D be a set of context documents {d1...dn} retrieved for a RAG input query. We define a set of relevant tokens in di as Ri = {t1, ...tr}. Ri encodes information in context document di that is useful for answering the query. Similarly, we define Ui = {t1, ...tu} as the set of utilized tokens in document di, which reflect information that the generation model is using to produce a response. Refer to Figure 3 for a visual representation of relevant and utilized spans. Len(x) measures the length of strings in x, which can be interpreted as character length, token length, or sentence length. For calculating ground-truth metrics, we employ sentence-length, since it aligns best with our annotation schema (Section 3.3). However, token or character length may also be suitable for other use cases."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|1cea70f78f314318bd8e5cdd82ec74cd
"Context Relevance Context Relevance is defined in [9, 33] as the fraction of the retrieved context that is relevant to the input query. Low relevance points to an inefficient retriever that supplies excess

information to the generation model. Long context inputs into the generator may accrue unnecessary costs, as well as compromise the quality of the generated output. We measure relevance of context document di as:

document relevance =

Len(Ri) Len(di)

Example-level relevance can be aggregated over all context documents in the example as:

example relevance =

(cid:80)|D|

i=1 Len(Ri) i=1 Len(di)

(cid:80)|D|

Context Utilization Context Utilization is a new metric introduced in TRACe. We aim to measure the the fraction of the retrieved context that is used by the generator to produce the response. Low Utilization in combination with low Relevance points to a greedy retriever, while low Utilization alone points to a weak generator that fails to leverage the provided context efficiently. Document-level and example-level Utilization are defined as:

document utilization =

Len(Ui) Len(di)

example utilization =

(cid:80)|D|

i=1 Len(Ui) i=1 Len(di)

(cid:80)|D|"|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|e6d55f5fd2764e5abc025ca57aefe590
"document utilization =

Len(Ui) Len(di)

example utilization =

(cid:80)|D|

i=1 Len(Ui) i=1 Len(di)

(cid:80)|D|

Completeness Completeness is another new metrics we introduce to measure how well the response incorporates all the relevant information in the context. Note that this is different from Utilization; it is possible to have high Relevance and high Utilization, but low Completeness when the generator utilizes irrelevant information in the context to produce a low quality response. Completeness for document di is calculated as the fraction of utilized substrings among all relevant substrings:

completeness =

Len(Ri ∩ Ui) Len(Ri)

And can be extended to example-level by considering all relevant and utilized substrings across all context documents.

Adherence Adherence is designed to detect hallucinations in RAG responses. Our definition of Adherence is synonymous with answer faithfullness [9, 33], groundednes [37], and attribution [32]. For alignment with existing hallucination detection approaches, we define example-level adherence as a boolean indicating whether or not all parts of the response are grounded in the context. However, in our annotation schema (Section 3.3) we also define Ai = {t1, ...ta} as the set of response tokens that are supported by the context to enable granular Adherence evaluation.

3.3 LLM annotator"|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|c02bd8191b5648b8985dc2369c8678b1
"3.3 LLM annotator

We prompt GPT-4 (gpt-4-0125-preview) to produce ground truth Adherence, Relevance, and Utilization labels for input (documents, query, response) tuples in RAGBench. Completeness is easily derived from span-level Relevance and Utilization annotations, thus we don’t request explicit annotations for it.

For high quality labels, we use proven techniques like chain of thought [40] that have been shown to maximize the correlation between GPT-4 and human judgements [43, 46]. For relevance and utilization we request the LLM-annotator to directly identify relevant and utilized sub-strings in the input documents. For adherence, we instruct the LLM to identify which response sentences, if any, are supported by the provided context. We can then derive an example-level boolean adherence label by checking if all response sentences are supported. The exact prompt used for annotation is provided in Appendix 9.4. We apply post-processing steps to ensure high quality, reliable annotations from our GPT-labeler, which we outline in Appendix 9.5. We further validate our annotation approach in Section 4, and discuss the limitations of using an LLM-annotator in Section 8."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|5995a6d0e89d4bf39d28a4ff6969a025
"RAGBench raw annotations contain token-level labels for utilization and relevance, which are converted to TRACe metrics using equations in Section 3.2. We encourage future work on automated evaluators to predict the raw token-level labels, like relevant and utilized spans, rather than predicting the example-level scores directly which are less interpretable for the end user.

4 Annotation Validation

We validate out metric formulations and labeling approach on simulated RAG datasets of varying quality. We use mock RAG datasets generated by Saad-Falcon et al. [33] for this analysis. Their RAG validation set is sampled from KILT [30], including Natural Questions (NQ)[18], HotpotQA[42], FEVER[36], and Wizards of Wikipedia (WoW) [8] datasets. The authors synthetically generate systems of varying quality by adjusting the ratio of relevant documents and responses in the data. We sample 500 examples from each simulated RAG dataset and annotated them as described in section 3.3. Next, we calculate average annotated context relevance and adherence scores for each dataset and use those to rank the mock systems. We compare our rankings to ground truth with the Kendall rank correlation (Kendall’s τ ) metric, which evaluates the agreement between two sets of ranks on a scale from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement)."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|35f8da963efc4bd6ad4f1d63d81bff80
"As shown in Table 2, the GPT-4 annotations achieve high Kendall’s τ ranging from 0.78 to 1. For a fair comparison with the ground truth labels, we derive binary context relevance and labels from the GPT-4 annotations by thresholding the example Relevance score (equation 2) at 0. For comparison, we also report ranking results with out more granular example-level Relevance scores that range from 0-1. We find that these metric produce a different ranking (see lower Kendall’s τ in Table 2), which we attribute to the metrics capturing differences in retrieved context length across the different examples.

5 Experiments

5.1 LLM Judge

We benchmarks a few LLM evaluators on RAGBench: (1) zero-shot GPT-3.5-judge, where we query GPT-3.5 with our annotation prompt, (2) RAGAS [9], and (3) TruLens [37]. RAGAS employs a series of few-shot prompts to GPT-3.5 to measure answer groundedness (Adherence) and Context Relevance metrics. Trulens is another zero-shot prompting approach that measures answer faithfulness (Adherence) and Context Relevance.

"5.2 Fine-tuned Judge

We fine-tune a DeBERTa-v3-Large [10] NLI checkpoint3 from Laurer et al. [19] with one key architecture modification: we add a shallow prediction head for each of the output RAG metrics, which allows us to compute all TRACe metrics in a single forward pass. This is both cost-effective and enables transfer learning from head to head through back-propagation down to the shared base layers. Each prediction head is a single layer feed-forward net that acts on the token-level output of the last DeBERTa layer.

We attach two heads on the context tokens to estimate Relevance and Utilization probabilities, and another head on the response tokens to estimate Adherence. For training, we broadcast sentence-level annotations to tokens, and tune to maximize token-level probabilities of Relevant, Utilized, and

Adherent spans. At inference, we impose a probability threshold=0.5 to predict Relevant and Utilized spans and Adherent spans and calculate TRACe metrics using equations 2, 3, and 4. For comparison with existing hallucination detection approaches, we also aggregate Adherence probabilities across the entire response to produce an example-level response adherence label. For details about training and hyperparameters, refer to Appendix 9.6.

5.3 Evaluation"|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|c4dadf77f2d941dbaa23fee4edbad9d8
"5.3 Evaluation

Our granular annotation schema allows for various evaluation setups. For example, we could evaluate either span-level or example/response-level predictions. For easy comparison with existing RAG evaluation approaches that are less granular, we report area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC) on the response-level hallucination detection task, and root mean squared error (RMSE) for example-level context Relevance and Utilization predictions.

6 Discussion

Table 3 reports results on test splits of each RAGBench component dataset. We compare baseline LLM methods with a finetunes DeBERTA encoder that trained on the full RAGBench train split.

LLMs underperform on the RAG evaluation task We observe that the finetuned DeBERTa model outperforms the few/zero-shot LLM-judge baselines on most datasets. While GPT-3.5 demonstrates competitive performance with DeBERTa on a few metrics, DeBERTa consistently achieves superior performance metrics across all evaluations. Despite the versatility of LLM judges across various tasks, their lack of specialization necessitates finetuning for optimal results. Future work may focus on finetuning LLM judges to close the gap between DeBERTA and GPT-4 evaluation performance. In Appendix 9.7, we demonstrate that, despite its small size, the finetuned DeBERTA model does generalize to out of domain RAG datasets in the same way that LLM-based approaches do."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|f541ff4ef3b146ee9db57c1cd8a31270
"Estimating Context Relevance is Difficult As shown in Table 3, Relevance RMSE scores are generally higher than those for Utilization, indicating a greater difficulty in the relevance prediction task. Utilization can be assessed through a straightforward semantic comparison between the context and the response. In contrast, relevance is a more intricate metric. Due to the nature of RAG, the majority of retrieved documents are semantically related to the query. However, mere semantic similarity is insufficient. The model must ascertain whether the provided context includes specific information necessary to accurately answer the question. Thus, the task inherently involves deriving

8

the correct answer, followed by assessing what information in the context may be used to arrive at that answer.

7 Conclusion

In this paper we introduce RAGBench, a large-scale dataset composed of real-world RAG examples intended for training and benchmarking RAG evaluation models. Additionally, we formulate TRACe, a RAG evaluation framework comprising four metrics: uTilization, Relevance, Adherence, and Completeness. TRACe standardizes the evaluation process, offering a consistent and systematic approach to measuring RAG system performance across various dimensions."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|463bd40defce4cb18a7dc1221ca05275
"We benchmark existing RAG evaluation framework using RAGBench and demonstrate that LLM- judges struggle to compete with a fine-tuned RAG evaluation expert model. Future work may involve fine-tuning larger expert models to explore the potential for narrowing the performance gap between these models and the ground truth.

Our contributions address the need for standardized benchmarks and methodologies, enabling more precise and actionable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different RAG systems. This, in turn, will facilitate the iterative improvement of RAG models, driving forward the capabilities of retrieval-augmented generation in real-world applications.

8 Limitations

LLM Annotations Though LLMs demonstrate high correlations with human judgements on a variety of tasks [6, 11], using them as a singular source of ground truth remains controversial [23]. At the same time, human judgements of LLM outputs are also prone to inconsistencies and bias. In [13], the authors find that human evaluators are often misled by the assertiveness and complexity of the LLM model output, which leads them to underestimate the rate of factuality errors in LLM responses."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|63246f8700f24a73b98b3a1a15fe088d
"In this work, we acknowledge the potential of noise and bias in RAGBench resulting from automated GPT-4-turbo annotations, and the concerns about the potential transmission of such biases into subsequent RAG systems. One way to address this in future may be to replace the GPT-4-annotator with and LLM ""jury"" as suggested in [38]. By aggregating judgements from diverse models, this approach can help reduce the noise and bias in the output judgements at low cost.

9.1 RAGBench Code and Data

We release RAGBench data on Hugginggface: rungalileo/ragbench. Refer to model card and documentation there.

https://huggingface.co/datasets/

We publish our inferfence and evaluation code on Gihub: https://github.com/rungalileo/ ragbench/tree/main/ragbench.

9.2 RAGBench Dataset Details

RAGBench is sourced from publicly released acadmic and industry datasets. As far as we know, none of the component datasets contain personally identifiable information or offensive content."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|01c9baf2f84d4d4e86c87ebc74128d64
"PubMedQA [15] PubMedQA is a collection of PubMed research abstracts with corresponding yes/no/maybe questions paired with each abstract. The original dataset comprises 3 subsets: PQA-L, PQA-U, and PQA-A, with 1k, 60k, and 210k abstracts, respectively. For all subsets, the question is derived from the title of the PubMed article using rule-based heuristics. Long answers are automatically derived from the last sentence of the abstract for PQA-L and PQA-U, and QA-L answers are further reviewed by expert annotators and annotated as yes/no/maybe. PQA-A comprises exclusively automatically generated questions and short answers.

For RAGBench we utilize the PQA-U subset and re-frame it from QA into a RAG task. To simulate RAG, we leverage already segmented PQA-U abstracts context chunks and we encode them into a vector DB with OpenAI embeddings. The size of the resulting DB is 200k. We retrieve 4 chunks for each PQA-U question using FAISS with eucledian distance as the similarity function. We ignore the responses and labels in the original dataset and generate new responses with an LLM.

CovidQA-RAG CovidQA-RAG is a combination of 2k expert-annotated questions sourced from COVID-QA [27] and a vector database of 250,000 100-word passages built by Siriwardhana et al. [35]. Both questions and answers are sourced from CORD-19 [39] collection of research articles about COVID-19."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|43cbd9b732d249cc87cce7efb9b52be8
"We embed the questions and database passages with OpenAI embeddings and retrieve up to N passages for each COVID-QA question from the vector database using FAISS with eucledian distance as the similarity function and max_distance=0.25. We generate responses for each resulting RAG (context, question) instance with an LLM.

13

HotpotQA [42] HotpotQA comprises 113K crowd-sourced question-answer pairs sourced from Wikipedia. Each pair is associated with a set of related context passages from one or multiple Wikipedia pages. The dataset is constructed in a way that requires multi-hop reasoning over multiple context documents to arrive at the answer, which renders it a valuable candidate for our benchmark. We sample data from the dev-distractor split, which contains up to 8 distractor context documents per sample. We downsample the context documents to 4 per example, making sure to include the document containing the response. We treat the context passages in HotpotQA as RAG context documents, and generate responses for each (context, question) instance with an LLM."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|d05f4df64f1044dea129c505f09085c1
"MS Marco [29] MS Marco is an open-domain question answering dataset sourced from Bing search engine user query logs. Each question is associated with 10 context passages retrieved via Bing web search. Human annotators compose a response based on the provided context documents, and label the documents utilized in the response as relevant. We sample data from the original version of the dataset, comprising 80k train, 10k validation, and 10k test samples. As with other datasets, we ignore the human annotated answers and generate responses with an LLM in RAG setting.

CUAD [12] CUAD is a collection of commercial legal contracts with expert annotated questions and responses. The contracts are sourced from a public legal contract library(EDGAR) and range from 1-100 pages in length. Experts in the legal domain compose multiple questions per contract and label the relevant parts of the contract that are useful for answering the questions. There are 21k questions pertaining to 510 documents in total. The questions are very specific to each contract, thus we don’t perform additional retrieval over the contract corpus, and form RAG examples with 1 context contract each for our benchmark. Due to high anntoation costs associated with long-context RAG, we sample 5 question per doc. As with other datasets, we generate responses with an LLM in RAG setting."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|aaaaeab9883e47fb8eeac54cf77c4df4
"DelucionQA [34] DelucionQA is a domain-specific RAG dataset leveraging Jeep’s 2023 Gladiator model manual as the source of knowledge. The questions and answers are automatically generated by large language models. RAG context passages are retrieved from the Jeep car manual via both sparse and dense retrieval methods to add variance in the sample distribution. Further, MTurk workers annotate whether or not responses are supported by the context.

Upon closer inspection, we found only 1 relevant passage associated with each question in the DelucionQA dataset. To make the dataset more challenging for RAGBench, we build a vector database from the 1,046 context passages in DelucionQA and and retrieve up to 3 context documents per question from it. We use text-embedding-ada-002 embeddings from OpenAI to build the database. There are 913 unique questions in DelucionQA. For each resulting (context, question) sample, we generate responses with an LLM."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|8d05d6c5ab3b4cd29fc5c3b6da5b3858
"EManual [28] EManual is a question answer dataset comprising consumer electronic device manuals and realistic questions about them composed by human annotators. The subset made available at the time of writing amounts to 659 unique questions about the Samsung Smart TV/remote and the accompanying user manual, segmented into 261 chunks. To form a RAG dataset, we embed the manual segments into a vector database with OpenAI embedding and retrieve up to 3 context documents per question from it. For each resulting (context, question) sample, we generate responses with an LLM.

TechQA [3] TechQA is a collection of real-world user questions posted on IBMDeveloper and DeveloperWorks forums, along with 50 technical support documents relating to each question. The documents are sourced from database of 800k technical documents that support accepted answers on the tech forums. The authors release 1.4k questions, split between train, validation, and test sets. The data are curated such that fractions on the each split unanswerable given the information in the linked documents, which makes it a good candidate for RAGBench. To reduce annotation costs, we sub-sample the data down to 10 documents per question, making sure to include the document containing the answer, when applicable. We use the provided splits with (context document, question) examples and generate responses for each with an LLM."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|f7648f85e95541698ce184a5fc12f5b1
"FinQA [5] FinQA is a QA dataset of financial report passages and associated questions. Questions are curated such that numerical reasoning over multiple unstructured and tabular inputs is required to

arrive at the answer. FinQA totals 8,281 financial QA pairs, split between train, validation, and test splits. We retain the original splits and generate 2 LLM responses per each context-query example in FinQA.

TAT-QA [47] TAT-QA is another financial QA dataset that requires numerical reasoning over tables and text. The data are sourced from 500 financial reports released on https://www. annualreports.com/. Expert annotators with background in finance annotate question-answer pairs based on the available documents. We leverage the full dataset (13k train, 1.6k validation and test) but generate new responses with LLMs for RAGBench.

HAGRID [16] HAGRID is a QA dataset built on top of MIRACL [45], a multi-lingual information- retrieval dataset. HAGRID passes questions and relevant context documents from MIRACLE through an LLM to produce a response for each example in the dataset. Annotors then rate the response on informativeness and attribution dimensions. The original context documents are sourced from Wikipedia and associated questions are generated by expert annotators. Since HAGRID already contains LLM-generated responses, we directly use them and don’t generate additional responses for RAGBench."|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|e460d3b22ee44909b71cbc0144edaeb9
"ExpertQA [26] ExpertQA is a collection of curated questions from domain-experts in various fields of sicence, arts, and law. The dataset also contains expert curated passsages relevant to each question, alongside LLM-generated responses. As with HAGRID, we leverage the LLM-generated responses in ExpertQA directly for our RAG dataset.

9.3 Response Generation Prompt

We use the following prompt template to generate LLM responses for each sample in RAGBench. Context documents, separated by line breaks, along with the question are slotted in for each generation sample.

Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

{documents}

Question: {question}

9.4 GPT Labeling Prompt

We use the following prompt template to generate annotations with GPT-4

I asked someone to answer a question based on one or more documents. Your task is to review their response and assess whether or not each sentence in that response is supported by text in the documents. And if so, which sentences in the documents provide that support. You will also tell me which of the documents contain useful information for answering the question, and which of the documents the answer was sourced from.

Here are the documents, each of which is split into sentences. Alongside each sentence is associated key, such as ’0a.’ or ’0b.’ that you can use to refer to it:

‘‘‘ {documents} ‘‘‘

The question was: ‘‘‘ {question} ‘‘‘

In this field, provide a step-by-step breakdown of the claims made in the response and the support (or lack thereof) for those claims in the documents. Begin by assessing each claim separately, one by one; don’t make any remarks about the response as a whole until you have assessed all the claims in isolation.

The overall_supported field is a boolean indicating whether the response as a whole is supported by the documents. This value should reflect the conclusion you drew at the end of your step-by-step breakdown in overall_supported_explanation.

9.5 Annotation Post-Processing Steps"|research_papers\RAGBench_Explainable_Benchmark_for_Retrieval-Augme.pdf|258b3195493f4fc79f4dc2cf1a2a1ae6
"9.5 Annotation Post-Processing Steps

As shown in Appendix 9.4, we request very detailed annotations with explanations from GPT-4-turbo. We pivot on chain-of-thought [40] and redundancy to encourage high quality labels from the annotator model.

For Adherence, we request both response-level and sentence-level annotations that we compare in post-processing to identify inconsistencies where GPT-4 disagrees with its own judgements. For example, if GPT-4 claims a response as supported by the context as a whole, but identifies no supporting information for one or more claims in the response, we send the example for re-annotation. We re-annotate all data up to 3 times, after which a fraction (<2%) of the data are still conflicting. After manual inspection, we find that the majority of the conflicts arise from partially hallucinated sentences that are somewhat, but not fully, grounded in the context. We leverage a sentence-level ""fully_supported"" boolean annotation to identify and resolve such cases. According to our annotation schema, we treat all partially supported sentences as hallucinations.

Since all TRACe metrics are related, we qualitatively observe that taking the extra measures for Adherence also positively impacts the quality and stability of the relevance and utilization labels.

With the exception of FinQA and TAT-QA, we find that the model still achieves reasonable generalization to the other domains in RAGBench. FinQA and TAT-QA are the two financial numerical reasoning datasets in RAGBench. The tabular nature of the FinQA and TAT-QA datasets contribute to the poor performance of the OOD model as such format would not have been seen in training.

Abstract

Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion (RAG) systems is inherently complex, requiring deep understanding of data, use cases, and intricate design decisions. Addi- tionally, evaluating these systems presents sig- nificant challenges, necessitating assessment of both retrieval accuracy and generative quality through a multi-faceted approach. We intro- duce RAG FOUNDRY, an open-source frame- work for augmenting large language models for RAG use cases. RAG FOUNDRY inte- grates data creation, training, inference and evaluation into a single workflow, facilitating the creation of data-augmented datasets for training and evaluating large language mod- els in RAG settings. This integration en- ables rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG techniques, allowing users to easily generate datasets and train RAG models using internal or specialized knowl- edge sources. We demonstrate the frame- work effectiveness by augmenting and fine- tuning Llama-3 and Phi-3 models with diverse RAG configurations, showcasing consistent im- provements across three knowledge-intensive datasets. Code is released as open-source in https://github.com/IntelLabs/RAGFoundry.

Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force in the field of AI, demon- strating an impressive ability to perform a wide range of tasks that traditionally required human in- telligence (Brown et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2022). Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have inherent limitations. These models can produce plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical an- swers, struggle with factual accuracy, lack access to up-to-date information after their training cutoff and struggle in attending to relevant information in large contexts (Huang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023).

"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs performance by integrating external infor- mation using retrieval mechanisms. Combining re- trieval that leverages vast knowledge-bases outside the knowledge of the model, effectively addresses knowledge limitations, can reduce hallucinations, improve the relevance of generated content, pro- vide interpretability and could be vastly more cost- efficient (Lewis et al., 2021; Mallen et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2023; Borgeaud et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2023; de Jong et al., 2023). Fur- thermore, recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs for RAG can achieve state-of-the-art perfor- mance, surpassing that of larger, proprietary mod- els (Yu et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2024).

However, the implementation of RAG systems is inherently complex and requires a series of intricate decisions that can significantly impact the performance of the system. This process de-"|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|55fa18b5b5ae49d89f2cb3b304ef4060
mands a thorough understanding of the data and use case, and often, solutions do not generalize well to other domains (Barnett et al., 2024; Bala- guer et al., 2024). Some key RAG design decisions include text embedding, indexing parameters, re- trieval algorithms, query building, and prompt de- sign, among other considerations beyond the LLM configuration (Wang et al., 2024). Another issue is reproducibility: achieving consistent and compara- ble results across runs, datasets and tasks. Varia- tions in training data, pre-processing steps, model configurations, and hardware can lead to discrep- ancies in performance, making it challenging for researchers and practitioners to replicate findings and build upon previous work. Additionally, evalu- ating RAG systems presents a challenge due to the dual reliance on retrieval accuracy and generative quality. These systems require a sophisticated eval- uation suite that accounts for the interplay among the retrieved information, the formalization of data, and the generated output (Chen et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024a; Es et al., 2024).|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|132a082599334a0c8bdd14b00b57b8b2
"We introduce RAG FOUNDRY, an open-source python framework for developing sophisticated retrieval-augmented LLMs for RAG use-cases. The library supports researchers and practitioners in the nuanced task of enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in RAG use cases. It is highly customizable, fa- cilitating rapid prototyping and experimentation across all aspects of RAG, including data selec- tion, aggregation and filtering, retrieval, text pro- cessing, document ranking, few-shot generation, prompt design using templates, fine-tuning, infer- ence, and evaluation. To cater to the specific needs of researchers, we designed the framework to func- tion as an end-to-end experimentation environment. The backbone of the library consists of four dis- tinct modules: data creation, training, inference, and evaluation. Each module is encapsulated and controlled by a configuration file, ensuring compat- ibility between the output of one module and the input of the next. This modular approach allows each step to be isolated and independently experi- mented with, enabling the production of multiple outputs and the concurrent execution of numerous experiments. Evaluation can be conducted on the generated outputs as well as on any feature within the data, including retrieval, ranking, and reason- ing.

To illustrate the utility of the framework, we conducted experiments involving retrieval, fine- tuning, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wu"|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|a4ff2baeee464136832cc832da117809
"To illustrate the utility of the framework, we conducted experiments involving retrieval, fine- tuning, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wu

(2023, 2022) presents a different approach, where LLM prompt- ing is represented as a programming language, to be optimized and compiled; a rather unique and general approach that could benefit RAG but has a high level of complexity due to the abstractions introduced. Saad-Falcon et al. (2024) focuses more on the evaluation aspect, by creating synthetic data and training an LLM critic to evaluate the RAG sys- tem. Hsia et al. (2024) studies aspects of retrieval on the performance of RAG; our RAG Foundry li- brary is general and enables experimentation on all aspects of RAG: retrieval, text-processing, prompt design, model selection, inference and evaluations. Recently, a concurrent work by Jin et al. (2024) proposes a RAG building framework, including some RAG implementations and datasets; we fo- cus on extensibility, letting users define custom types of pipelines with custom components. Rau et al. (2024) presents a framework, sharing a similar design-principle of extensibility-through- configuration as ours; their library imposes a spe- cific workflow structure (retriever, ranker, LLM) while our library is more general and does not im- poses any specific paradigm.

3.1 Data Creation and Processing"|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|9919ecb8592a4297a319063617ae8be2
"3.1 Data Creation and Processing

The processing module facilitates the creation of context-enhanced datasets by persisting RAG in- teractions, which are essential for RAG-oriented training and inference (Berchansky et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024b). These interactions encompass dataset loading, column normalization, data aggregation, information retrieval, template- based prompt creation, and various other forms of

pre-processing. The processed data can be saved in a consistent, model-independent format, along with all associated metadata, ensuring compatibil- ity and reproducibility across different models and experiments.

The processing module is comprised of an ab- stract pipeline with multiple steps, each defined by Python classes that implement specific data pro- cessing functionalities. These steps are categorized into two types:

Global Steps: Can act on the dataset as a whole, making them useful for operations such as aggre- gations, group-by, examples filtering, join opera- tions, and more.

Local Steps: Operate on individual examples, making them suitable for tasks such as retrieval, text processing, and field manipulation. The modular design allows for building flexible and efficient data processes, tailored to the needs of RAG-oriented training and inference. Steps can be categorized into the following non-exclusive categories:

Loaders: Load datasets from the Hugging Face1 hub or from local sources."|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|2d4d9c35fed7427d95838934d62e920f
"Loaders: Load datasets from the Hugging Face1 hub or from local sources.

Selectors: Filter examples, shuffle datasets, and select subset datasets.

Retrievers: Integrate information from external databases, tools, libraries and pipelines.

Samplers: Collect random examples or features from any dataset to compile few-shot or negative examples.

Prompters: Format prompts using custom tem- plates and keyword mappings.

The processing module supports the handling of multiple datasets at once, through global dataset sharing. This feature allows each step of the pipeline to access any of the loaded datasets, en- hancing flexibility and allowing for complex pro- cessing procedures. Furthermore, the module in- cludes step caching, which caches each pipeline step locally. This improves compute efficiency, and facilitates easy reproduction of results.

Listing 1 demonstrates how such a processing pipeline is defined using a YAML configuration.

"The first two steps in listing 1 load datasets from Hugging Face hub and from a local path. The third step shuffles and selects 10k examples from the main dataset. The forth step runs a Haystack-based (Pietsch et al., 2019) retrieval pipeline to retrieve relevant passages using questions from the loaded dataset as queries, storing them in docs_key. We note that different retrieval processes or frame- works (Liu, 2022; Chase, 2022; Lin et al., 2021) can be used in retrieval steps. The fifth step selects 3 few-shot examples from the secondary dataset, following a prompt generator step that loads a prompt template and replaces all given informa- tion according to the defined mapping dictionary. Lastly, the dataset is saved to a local path.

3.2 Training

We provide a training module to fine-tune models given the datasets created by the previous process- ing module. The training module relies on the well established training framework TRL2 and sup-

3.3

Inference

The inference module generates predictions given the processed datasets created by the processing module. Inference is conceptually separated from the evaluation step, since it is more computation- ally demanding than evaluation. Additionally, one can run multiple evaluations on a single, prepared inference results file. An example configuration for generating predictions given a dataset is presented in listing 3.

3.4 Evaluation"|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|e0232b222004490383ef43bd2bbd2c33
"3.4 Evaluation

The goal of the framework is augmenting LLMs for RAG. The evaluation module allows users to run collections of metrics to evaluate RAG tech- niques and tuning processes. The evaluation mod- ule loads the output of the inference module and runs a configurable list of metrics. Metrics are classes implemented in the library. These classes can be as simple as wrappers around other evalua- tion libraries, or can be implemented by the user. Local metrics can be run on individual examples, like Exact Match (EM), while Global metrics run on the entire dataset as a whole, e.g. Recall (for classification-based metrics). Metrics can use any field and metadata in the dataset, not just the input- output pairs. Some of the metrics implemented in the library include: a wrapper for the Hugging Face evaluate library, EM, F1, classification met- rics, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), Semantic Similarity and a wrapper for DeepEval3 (for using

the RAGAS metrics (Es et al., 2024)). After the evaluation is completed, a results file is written to disk with the local and global metrics results.

Furthermore, the evaluation module uses a pro- cessing step called an Answer Processor, which can implement custom logic and serve many pur- poses, including cleaning and aligning outputs; for example, using regex, one can isolate answers, re- move stop words, chain-of-thought reasoning, de- fine a stopping criteria, process citations and attri- butions and any other form of processing needed for a given evaluation.

See listing 4 for a configuration example; it con- tains an answer processor that extracts an answer from an output, and a list of metrics to run.

4 Experiments: RAG Tuning

To illustrate the usage and usefulness of the RAG FOUNDRY library, we experiment with sev- eral possible RAG improvements to LLMs, and evaluate the results on three knowledge-intensive tasks.

4.1 RAG Augmentation Techniques"|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|393751b474a34b8d9dfd6a642c50cbb1
"4.1 RAG Augmentation Techniques

We explore several techniques for RAG augmenta- tion, and use RAG FOUNDRY to easily implement and evaluate their benefit. As an initial step, we evaluate unmodified models; we set Baseline as a configuration that is defined by running unmodified models and without any external knowledge. We define a RAG setting that introduces top-relevant documents in a consistent prompt template format with a system instruction, and a CoT scheme which

guides the model to use the retrieved context, ex- plain the steps, quote relevant parts and produce a final answer. Complementing that, we explore fine-tuning recipes. We fine-tune the model in the RAG setup and denote is as RAG-sft. To comple- ment CoT, we implemented a fine-tuning recipe, denoted as CoT-sft, introduced in (Zhang et al., 2024), where gold documents and purely distractor documents are used in the prompt, determined by probability, in conjunction with a CoT prompt. All prompt templates are included in appendix A.1.

4.2 Datasets

We evaluate our models on TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), PubmedQA (Jin et al., 2019), and ASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022) which are knowledge in- tensive question-answering datasets which ben- efit from external sources. The TriviaQA and PubmedQA datasets contain relevant context; for ASQA, retrieval was done over a Wikipedia corpus using a dense retriever4. Dataset sources and sizes are included in appendix A.2.

4.3 Models"|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|6d3d951874f04cca9cd12410e25abed1
"4.3 Models

We experiment with two representative models: Llama-35 (Touvron et al., 2023; AI@Meta, 2024) and Phi-36 (Abdin et al., 2024) as they represent robust capabilities and are ideal candidate models for RAG use case deployments.

4.4 Evaluation

We measure and report Exact Match (EM) for TriviaQA, STR-EM for ASQA, accuracy and F1 for PubmedQA. Additionally, we evaluate two RAGAS metrics (Es et al., 2024): Faithfulness and Relevancy. Faithfulness measures the relation be- tween the generated text and the context. Relevancy measures the relation between the generated text and the query. These two metrics use the context as input for the LLM critic, so are only relevant in the RAG settings. The critic LLM used is GPT4-32k, version 0613. An embedder7 is required for the relevancy evaluation.

4.5 Results

We present a comparative study of RAG augmenta- tion techniques, on the TriviaQA, ASQA and Pub- medQA datasets. Results are presented in table 1:

"main metrics for each dataset are displayed, as well as faithfulness and relevancy scores, as defined in (Es et al., 2024). For TriviaQA we observe the following: retrieved context improves the results, fine-tuning the RAG setting improves the results, fine-tuning on CoT reasoning (which includes train- ing on a combination of gold passages and distrac- tor passages) decreases performance. Best method is model dependent for this dataset. For ASQA, we similarly observe every method improves upon the baseline, CoT reasoning produces consistent improvement in both models, as well as fine-tuning of the CoT configuration, which shows to perform best. Finally, for PubmedQA, we observe that al- most all methods improve upon the baseline (with one exception); CoT reasoning improves upon the untrained RAG setting, but upon fine-tuning, the RAG method appears to perform best in both mod- els.

5 Conclusion

We introduced RAG FOUNDRY, an open-source library dedicated to the task of RAG-augmentation of LLMs, namely fine-tuning LLMs to become bet- ter at RAG settings. The library is designed to serve as an end-to-end experimentation environment, en- abling users to quickly prototype and experiment with different RAG techniques. We demonstrated the usefulness of the library by augmenting two models with RAG configurations, evaluating on three Q&A datasets and showing the benefit of RAG techniques, as well as of using multi-aspect metrics relevant for RAG systems evaluation."|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|a5d84c86d6f041ca8d42d86c5a0f622e
"Limitations and Future Plans

Inspecting the faithfulness and relevancy scores, notice that not all configurations are valid to be measured: these metrics require context, so are irrelevant for the baseline method. Additionally, in the PubmedQA dataset, the answers are binary Yes/No; only in the CoT configurations the LLMs produce a reasoning, which can be evaluated. Fi- nally, the faithfulness and relevancy scores often do not correlate with the main metrics, neither with each other, possibly indicating they capture differ- ent aspects of the retrieval and generated results, and represent a trade-off in performance.

Our hope is that the library will be useful to as many people and use-cases as possible. However, due to time and resource constraint, we were able to demonstrate its usefulness on a subset of tasks and datasets. Future work can expand the evaluation to other tasks, as well as implementing other RAG techniques and evaluations.

Although we designed the library to be general and customizable, there might be specific work- flows which will be difficult to run as-is and some code changes may be required. The library proved useful for our own research projects on a diverse set of datasets and tasks and extending it is easy and straightforward."|research_papers\RAG_Foundry_A_Framework_for_Enhancing_LLMs_for_Ret.pdf|5bd7900ace3a47a5a20a03c523ea814b
"The results demonstrate the usefulness of RAG techniques for improving performance, as well as the need to carefully evaluate different aspects of a RAG system, on a diverse set of datasets, as effort on developing generalized techniques is ongoing.

Finally, despite our best efforts to offer detailed documentation in the library, there could be some missing details regarding some functionality or spe- cific use-cases. The code repository will accept suggestions, bug-fixes and pull requests.

Ethics Statement

In conducting our research we strive abiding to the highest ethical standards, including integrity, fairness, and societal benefit of our work. We pri- oritized data privacy and security throughout our research; any data used in our experiments was publicly available and did not contain any private information. We are committed to the principles of transparency and reproducibility; the methodolo- gies, including data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation are documented in order to enable others to replicate our findings. Code is made avail- able in an open repository. We advocate for the responsible use of LLMs and RAG augmentation. It is essential to exercise caution and verify the ac- curacy and reliability of generated text produced by LLMs. Hallucinations can have negative implica- tions, and even when RAG methods can ameliorate some of these aspects, verification and inspections are needed.

"ABSTRACT Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabil- ities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from lim- itations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering community.

build new HCI solutions, complete complex tasks, summarise docu- ments, answer questions in a given artefact(s), and generate new content. However, LLMs suffer from limitations when it comes to up-to-date knowledge or domain-specific knowledge currently captured in company’s repositories. Two options to address this problem are: a) Finetuning LLMs (continue training an LLM using domain specific artifacts) which requires managing or serving a fine-tuned LLM; or b) use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems that rely on LLMs for generation of answers using existing (extensible) knowledge artifacts. Both options have pros and cons related to privacy/security of data, scalability, cost, skills required, etc. In this paper, we focus on the RAG option."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|a3cb03964a3144f1a66cb8aaa128cf7c
"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offer a com- pelling solution to this challenge. By integrating retrieval mecha- nisms with the generative capabilities of LLMs, RAG systems can synthesise contextually relevant, accurate, and up-to-date informa- tion. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combines information retrieval capabilities, and generative prowess of LLMs. The retrieval component focuses on retrieving relevant information for a user query from a data store. The generation component fo- cuses on using the retrieved information as a context to generate an answer for the user query. RAG systems are an important use case as all unstructured information can now be indexed and available to query reducing development time no knowledge graph creation and limited data curation and cleaning.

"Software engineers building RAG systems are expected to pre- process domain knowledge captured as artifacts in different formats, store processed information in appropriate data store (vector data- base), implement or integrate the right query-artifact matching strategy, rank matched artifacts, and call the LLMs API passing in user queries and context documents. New advances for building RAG systems are constantly emerging [8, 12] but how they relate and perform for a specific application context has to be discovered. In this work we present the lessons learned and 7 failure points arising from 3 case studies. The purpose of this paper is to provide 1) a reference to practitioners and 2) to present a research road map for RAG systems. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first empirical insight into the challenges with creating robust RAG systems. As advances in LLMs continue to take place, the software engineering community has a responsibility to provide knowledge on how to realise robust systems with LLMs. This work is an important step for robustness in building RAG systems.

Research questions for this work include:

What are the failure points that occur when engineering a RAG system? (section 5) We present an empirical experiment using the BioASQ data set to report on potential failure points. The experiment involved 15,000 documents and 1000 question

and answer pairs. We indexed all documents then ran the queries and stored the generated responses using GPT-4. All question and answer pairs were then validated with OpenAI evals 1. Manual inspection (all discrepancies, all flagged as incorrect, and a sample of correct labels) was analysed to identify the patterns.

What are the key considerations when engineering a RAG system? (section 6) We present the lessons learned from three case studies involving the implementation of a RAG system. This presents the challenges faced and insights gained.

Contributions arising from this work include:

A catalogue of failure points (FP) that occur in RAG systems. • An experience report from 3 case studies of implementing a RAG system. Two currently running at Deakin University. • A research direction for RAG systems based on the lessons learned from the 3 case studies.

2 RELATED WORK Retrieval augmented generation encompasses using documents to augment large language models through pre-training and at inference time [7, 9, 12]. Due to the compute cost, data preparation time and required resources using RAG without training or fine- tuning is an attractive proposition. However, challenges arise when using large language models for information extraction such as performance with long text [8]."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|d763b443fb6f4b35af75f55071ea42e8
"A recent survey [19] showed that large language models are used across the RAG pipeline including retriever, data generation, rewriter, and reader. Our work complements this survey by taking a software engineering perspective to shine a light on what issues engineers will face and what software engineering research is nec- essary to realise solutions with the current state-of-the-art RAG systems.

Emerging work has looked at benchmarking RAG systems [3] but not at the failures occurring during implementation. Software engineering research has investigated the use of RAG systems for code-related tasks [15]. However, the application of RAG systems is broader than software engineering tasks. This paper comple- ments existing work by presenting challenges faced during the implementation of a RAG system with a focus on practitioners.

Errors and failures that arise from RAG systems overlap with other information retrieval systems including 1) no metrics for query rewriting, 2) document re-ranking, and 3) effective content summarisation [19]. Our results confirm this The unique aspects are related to the semantic and generative nature of the use of large language models including evaluating factual accuracy [16]."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|f35a4e3479224bf481aa5d59b242688e
"3 RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION With the explosion in popularity of large language model services such as ChatGPT2, Claude3, and Bard 4, people have explored their use as a question and answering systems. While the performance is impressive [16] there are two fundamental challenges: 1) hallu- cinations - where the LLM produces a response that looks right

but is incorrect, and 2) unbounded - no way to direct or update the content of the output (other than through prompt engineering). A RAG system is an information retrieval approach designed to overcome the limitations of using a LLM directly.

RAG works by taking a natural language query is converted into an embedding which is used to semantically search a set of docu- ments. Retrieved documents are then passed to a large language model to generate an answer. An overview of a RAG system is shown in Figure 1 as two separate processes, Index and Query. See this survey for more details [19]"|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|7e26d6cf402540a69e5ad9e649ba1a62
"3.1 Index Process In a RAG system, the retrieval system works using embeddings that provide a compressed semantic representation of the docu- ment. An embedding is expressed as a vector of numbers. During the Index process each document is split into smaller chunks that are converted into an embedding using an embedding model. The original chunk and the embedding are then indexed in a database. Software engineers face design decisions around how best to chunk the document and how large a chunk should be. If chunks are too small certain questions cannot be answered, if the chunks are too long then the answers include generated noise.

Different types of documents require different chunking and pro- cessing stages. For example, video content requires a transcription pipeline to extract the audio and convert to text prior to encoding (see subsection 4.2. The choice of which embedding to use also matters as changing the embedding strategy requires re-indexing all chunks. An embedding should be chosen based on the ability to semantically retrieve correct responses. This process depends on the size of the chunks, the types of questions expected, the structure of the content and the application domain."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|19e0aeb0261246b6b2fee067764785f2
"3.2 Query Process The Query process takes place at run time. A question expressed as natural language is first converted into a general query. To gen- eralise the query a large language model is used which enables additional context such as previous chat history to be included in the new query. An embedding is then calculated from the new query to use for locating relevant documents from the database. Top-k similar documents are retrieved using a similarity method such as cosine similarity (vector databases have techniques such as inverted indexes to speed up retrieval time). The intuition is that chunks that are semantically close to the query are likely to contain the answer.

Retrieved documents are then re-ranked to maximise the likeli- hood that the chunk with the answer is located near the top. The next stage is the Consolidator which is responsible for processing the chunks. This stage is needed to overcome the limitations of large language models 1) token limit and 2) rate limit. Services such as OpenAI have hard limits on the amount of text to include in a prompt. This restricts the number of chunks to include in a prompt to extract out an answer and a reduction strategy is needed to chain prompts to obtain an answer. These online services also restrict the number of tokens to use within a time frame restricting the latency of a system. Software engineers need to consider these tradeoffs when designing a RAG system."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|4f51a46cf38249bbbea17643e95ada32

Figure 1: Indexing and Query processes required for creating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The indexing process is typically done at development time and queries at runtime. Failure points identified in this study are shown in red boxes. All required stages are underlined. Figure expanded from [19].

The final stage of a RAG pipeline is when the answer is extracted from the generated text. Readers are responsible for filtering the noise from the prompt, adhering to formatting instructions (i.e. an- swer the question as a list of options), and producing the output to return for the query. Implementation of a RAG system requires cus- tomising multiple prompts to process questions and answers. This process ensures that questions relevant for the domain are returned. The use of large language models to answer real time questions from documents opens up new application domains where question and answering is new capability. Thus, RAG systems are difficult to test as no data exists and needs to be experimentally discov- ered through either a) synthetic data generation, or b) piloting the system with minimal testing."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|6894e2dfec6f44e7a86949d5ec676c40

4.2 AI Tutor The AI Tutor is a RAG system where students ask questions about the unit and answers are sourced from the learning content. Stu- dents are able to verify the answers by accessing a sources list from where the answer came from. The AI Tutor works by integrating into Deakin’s learning management system, indexing all of the content including PDF documents, videos, and text documents. As part of the Index process, videos are transcribed using the deep learning model Whisper [17] before being chunked. The AI Tutor was developed between August 2023 to November 2023 for a pilot in a unit with 200 students that commenced the 30th of October 2023. Our intention is to present the lessons learned during imple- mentation and present a followup findings at the conclusion of the pilot. This RAG pipeline includes a rewriter to generalise queries. We implemented a chat interface where previous dialogue between the user and the AI Tutor was used as part of the context for each question. The rewriter considers this context and rewrites the query to resolve ambiguous requests such as ‘Explain this concept further.’|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|00c40aa0f5014678ac99bd6dc93a0b52
"4.1 Cognitive Reviewer Cognitive Reviewer is a RAG system designed to support researchers in analysing scientific documents. Researchers specify a research question or objective and then upload a collection of related re- search papers. All of the documents are then ranked in accordance with the stated objective for the researcher to manually review. The researcher can also ask questions directly against all of the documents. Cognitive Reviewer is currently used by PhD students from Deakin University to support their literature reviews. The Cognitive Reviewer does the Index process at run time and relies

4.3 Biomedical Question and Answer The previous case studies focused on documents with smaller con- tent sizes. To explore the issues at a larger scale we created a RAG system using the BioASQ [10] dataset comprised of questions, links to document, and answers. The answers to questions were one of yes/no, text summarisation, factoid, or list. This dataset was pre- pared by biomedical experts and contains domain specific question and answer pairs. We downloaded 4017 open access documents from the BioASQ dataset and had a total of 1000 questions. All documents were indexed and the questions asked against the RAG system. The generated questions were then evaluated using the

OpenEvals technique implemented by OpenAI6. From the gener- ated questions we manually inspected 40 issues and all issues that the OpenEvals flagged as inaccurate. We found that the automated evaluation was more pessimistic than a human rater for this domain. However, one threat to validity with this finding is that BioASQ is a domain specific dataset and the reviewers were not experts i.e. the large language model may know more than a non-expert.

FP7 Incomplete Incomplete answers are not incorrect but miss some of the information even though that information was in the context and available for extraction.

"6 LESSONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

5 FAILURE POINTS OF RAG SYSTEMS From the case studies we identified a set of failure points presented below. The following section addresses the research question What are the failure points that occur when engineering a RAG system? FP1 Missing Content The first fail case is when asking a ques- tion that cannot be answered from the available documents. In the happy case the RAG system will respond with some- thing like “Sorry, I don’t know"". However, for questions that are related to the content but don’t have answers the system could be fooled into giving a response.

FP2 Missed the Top Ranked Documents The answer to the question is in the document but did not rank highly enough to be returned to the user. In theory, all documents are ranked and used in the next steps. However, in practice the top K documents are returned where K is a value selected based on performance.

FP3 Not in Context - Consolidation strategy Limitations Documents with the answer were retrieved from the data- base but did not make it into the context for generating an answer. This occurs when many documents are returned from the database and a consolidation process takes place to retrieve the answer.

FP4 Not Extracted Here the answer is present in the context, but the large language model failed to extract out the correct answer. Typically, this occurs when there is too much noise or contradicting information in the context."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|fe2a0223c1494506bbf223bae96a0563

The lessons learned from the three case studies are shown in Table 2. We present our findings for the research question: What are the key considerations when engineering a RAG system? Based on our takeaways we identified multiple potential research areas linked to RAG as follows:"|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|e1692011349c4bf8b17ef205a1cf27dd
6.1 Chunking and Embeddings Chunking documents sounds trivial. However, the quality of chunk- ing affects the retrieval process in many ways and in particular on the embeddings of the chunk then affects the similarity and matching of chunks to user queries. There are two ways of chunk- ing: heuristics based (using punctuation, end of paragraph, etc.), and semantic chunking (using the semantics in the text to inform start-end of a chunk). Further research should explore the tradeoffs between these methods and their effects on critical downstream processes like embedding and similarity matching. A systematic evaluation framework comparing chunking techniques on metrics like query relevance and retrieval accuracy would benefit the field. Embeddings represent another active research area, including generating embeddings for multimedia and multimodal chunks such as tables, figures, formulas, etc. Chunk embeddings are typ- ically created once during system development or when a new document is indexed. Query preprocessing significantly impacts a RAG system’s performance, particularly handling negative or ambiguous queries. Further research is needed on architectural pat- terns and approaches [5] to address the inherent limitations with embeddings (quality of a match is domain specific).|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|1091624f000a4e1b9a47593f08bdb48f
"FP6 Incorrect Specificity The answer is returned in the re- sponse but is not specific enough or is too specific to address the user’s need. This occurs when the RAG system designers have a desired outcome for a given question such as teach- ers for students. In this case, specific educational content should be provided with answers not just the answer. Incor- rect specificity also occurs when users are not sure how to ask a question and are too general.

6.2 RAG vs Finetuning LLMs are great world models due to the amount of training data, and finetuning tasks applied on the model before it’s released. However, these models are general-purpose models (may not know the very specifics of your domain) and also not up to date (there is a cutoff date on their knowledge). Fine-tuning and RAG offer two potential customisation pathways, each with distinct tradeoffs. Finetuning requires curating internal datasets to adapt and train the LLM on. However, all your data are baked into the model and you need to

RAG systems struggle with concurrent users due to rate limits and the cost of LLMs. Prepopulate the semantic cache with frequently asked questions [1]. Research suggests fine-tuning LLMs reverses safety training [11], test all fine-tuned LLMs for RAG sys- tem. Adding the file name and chunk number into the retrieved context helped the reader extract the re- quired information. Useful for chat dialogue. Opensource sentence embedding models performed as well as closed source alternatives on small text. RAG systems receive unknown input at runtime requiring constant monitoring. A RAG system requires calibrating chunk size, embedding strategy, chunking strategy, retrieval strategy, consolidation strategy, context size, and prompts. End-to-end training enhances domain adaptation in RAG systems [18]. Offline evaluation techniques such as G-Evals [14] look promising but are premised on having access to labelled question and answer pairs.

sort out the security/privacy (who can access what). Furthermore, as the foundation model itself evolves or you get new data to add to the model, you will need to run finetuning again. On the other side, RAG systems seem to offer a pragmatic solution allowing you to chunk your data as needed and only use relevant chunks into the context to ask the LLM to generate an answer from the included context. This facilitates continuously updating the knowledge with new documents and also gives the control over what chunks the user is able to access. However, optimal strategies for chunk embedding, retrieval, and contextual fusion remain active research. Further work should systematically compare finetuning and RAG paradigms across factors including accuracy, latency, operating costs, and robustness.

6.3 Testing and Monitoring RAG systems Software engineering best practices are still emerging for RAG sys- tems. Software testing and test case generation are one of the areas for refinement. RAG systems require questions and answers that are application specific often unavailable when indexing unstructured documents. Emerging work has considered using LLMs for gen- erating questions from multiple documents [4]. How to generate realistic domain relevant questions and answers remains an open problem."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|d7a5ad7e27124707ad69d614d5d335e6
"Once suitable test data is available quality metrics are also re- quired to assist engineers in making quality tradeoffs. Using large language models is expensive, introduces latency concerns, and has performance characteristics that all change with each new release.

This characteristic has previously been studied for machine learn- ing systems [5, 6] but the required adaptations (if any) have yet to be applied to LLM based systems such as RAGs. Another idea is to incorporate ideas from self-adaptive systems to support monitoring and adapting RAG systems, preliminary work has started for other machine learning applications [2].

7 CONCLUSION RAG systems are a new information retrieval that leverages LLMs. Software engineers increasingly interact with RAG systems a) through implementing semantic search, or b) through new code- dependent tasks. This paper presented the lessons learned from 3 case studies including an empirical investigation involving 15,000 documents and 1000 questions. Our findings provide a guide to practitioners by presenting the challenges faced when implement- ing RAG systems. We also included future research directions for RAG systems related to 1) chunking and embeddings, 2) RAG vs Finetuning, and 3) Testing and Monitoring. Large language models are going to continue to obtain new capabilities of interest to engi- neers and researchers. This paper presents the first investigation into RAG systems from a software engineering perspective."|research_papers\Seven_Failure_Points_When_Engineering_a_Retrieval_.pdf|dee0d9bcf96c49cf8ae73455b9365f52

"Abstract

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique to facilitate language model with proprietary and private data, where data privacy is a pivotal concern. Whereas extensive research has demonstrated the privacy risks of large language models (LLMs), the RAG tech- nique could potentially reshape the inherent behaviors of LLM generation, posing new pri- vacy issues that are currently under-explored. In this work, we conduct extensive empiri- cal studies with novel attack methods, which demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems on leaking the private retrieval database. De- spite the new risk brought by RAG on the re- trieval data, we further reveal that RAG can mitigate the leakage of the LLMs’ training data. Overall, we provide new insights in this paper for privacy protection of retrieval- augmented LLMs, which benefit both LLMs and RAG systems builders.

Introduction

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Liu, 2022; Chase, 2022; Van Veen et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023) is an advanced natural lan- guage processing technique that enhances text gen- eration by integrating information retrieved from a large corpus of documents. These techniques enable RAG to produce accurate and contextually relevant outputs with augmented external knowl- edge and have been widely used in various scenar- ios such as domain-specific chatbots (Siriwardhana et al., 2023) and email/code completion (Parvez et al., 2021). RAG systems typically work in two phases, as shown in Fig 1 - retrieval and generation. When a user query is entered, relevant knowledge is first retrieved from an external database. The retrieved data is then combined with the original

"In this paper, we focus on studying the risk of privacy leakage in the RAG system, and we argue that the information from both retrieval dataset and the pre-training/fine-tuning dataset (of the LLM) are potential to be released by RAG usage. On one hand, the retrieval dataset can contain sensi- tive, valuable domain-specific information (Parvez et al., 2021; Kulkarni et al., 2024), such as patients prescriptions can be used for RAG-based medical chatbots (Yunxiang et al., 2023). On the other hand, the retrieval process in RAG could also influ- ence the behavior of the LLMs for text-generation, and this could possibly cause the LLMs to output private information from its training/fine-tuning dataset. Notably, there are existing works (Car- lini et al., 2021; Kandpal et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2023) ob- serving that LLMs can remember and leak private information from their pre-training and fine-tuning data. However, how the integration of external re- trieval data can affect the memorization behavior of LLMs in RAG is still unclear and worth further exploration. Therefore, these concerns motivate us to answer the research questions:

(RQ1) Can we extract private data from the external retrieval database in RAG?

(RQ2) Can retrieval data affect the memoriza- tion of LLMs in RAG?"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|40ef27ab5cef44e9828df11e618b310f
"(RQ1) Can we extract private data from the external retrieval database in RAG?

(RQ2) Can retrieval data affect the memoriza- tion of LLMs in RAG?

Regarding RQ1, to fully uncover the privacy leakage of the retrieval dataset, we consider there exists an attacker, who aims to extract private in- formation from the retrieval dataset intentionally. We proposed a composite structured prompting at- tack method specific for extracting retrieval data, which is composed of the {information} part for context retrieval and {command} part to let LLMs output retrieved contexts. In detail, take our study on RAG for medical dialogue (Section 3.2) as an example, the attacker can ask the model for general information or suggestions related to certain dis- eases. More importantly, we propose to append an extra “command prompt” (see Section 3.2) during inquiry to improve the successful rate of extraction. After that, we examine the model’s output to see whether it contains information about specific pre- scription records, which may hurt the privacy of patients. Based our empirical study, we observe that our studied models (Llama2-7b-Chat and GPT- 3.5-turbo) can output verbatim or highly similar records with very high rates (near 50%). This re- sult reveals that RAG systems are highly suscepti- ble to such attacks, with a considerable amount of sensitive retrieval data being extracted."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|132856d8b86048fd998dff67b6f3bd5e
"Regarding RQ2, while prior work has shown that LLMs exhibit a propensity to output memo- rized training data, verifying the influence of re- trieval data integration remains unexplored. There- fore, we conduct targeted and prefix attacks on LLMs’ training corpus, comparing training data exposure with and without retrieval augmentation. We discover that incorporating retrieval data into RAG systems can substantially reduce LLMs’ ten- dency to output its memorized training data, achiev- ing greater protection than noise injection or system prompts. From a training data security perspective, our findings indicate that RAG may provide a safer architecture compared to using LLMs sorely.

2 Related Work

2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), first intro- duced by Lewis et al. (2020), has emerged as one of the most popular approaches to enhance the gen- eration ability of LLMs (Liu, 2022; Chase, 2022; Van Veen et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023). This synergy markedly boosts the output’s accuracy and relevance (Gao et al., 2023), mitigat- ing essential issues commonly referred to as ""hal-"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|4726089d815d41e2a4ca5b0cc1ed1347
"lucinations"" of LLMs (Shuster et al., 2021). One of RAG’s distinctive features is its flexible archi- tecture, allowing for the seamless interchange or update of its three core components: the dataset, the retriever, and the LLM. This flexibility means that adjustments to any of these elements can be made without necessitating re-training or fine-tuning of the entire system (Shao et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2023). These unique advantages have positioned RAG as a favored approach for a range of practi- cal applications, including personal chatbots and specialized domain experts like medical diagnostic assistants(Panagoulias et al., 2024).

2.2 Privacy Risk of Large Language Models"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|38f2faa3d5dc4c5bbd87b11574fc71bc
"2.2 Privacy Risk of Large Language Models

A body of research has demonstrated that LLMs are prone to memorizing and inadvertently reveal- ing information from their pre-training corpora (Carlini et al., 2021; Kandpal et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2022; Ippolito et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021; Biderman et al., 2023; Mireshghallah et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). No- tably, Carlini et al. (2021) pioneered the investiga- tion into data extraction attacks, revealing LLMs’ tendency to recall and reproduce segments of their training data. Following this, subsequent studies further identified various factors, such as model size, data duplication, and prompt length that in- crease such memorization risk (Carlini et al., 2022; Biderman et al., 2023). Moreover, for the privacy risks associated with fine-tuning data, (Mireshghal- lah et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023). Mireshghallah et al. (2022) discovered that fine- tuning model heads lead to more significant memo- rization than adjusting smaller adapter modules. Furthermore, Zeng et al. (2023) examined how memorization varies across different fine-tuning tasks, noting particular vulnerabilities in tasks that demand extensive feature representation, such as dialogue and summarization. Huang et al. (2023) has investigated the privacy risk of retrieval-based kNN-LM(Khandelwal et al., 2019), while it is dif- ferent from our work as kNN-LM has a different architecture and mechanism.

"3 Method

To answer the RQ1 and RQ2 in Section 1, we con- duct various attacks that aim at quantifying the leakage risks associated with different components of the RAG framework. This section begins with an overview of RAG’s background and the threat model, and followed by our attack methods for

retrieval and training data.

3.1 Background and Threat Model

RAG Pipeline. A typical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system involves a large lan- guage model M , a retrieval dataset D, and a re- triever R. Given a user query q, the system is designed to produce an answer a. In the RAG pro- cess, the retriever R is tasked with identifying the Top-k relevant documents from D corresponding to the query q. This is more formally denoted as:

R(q, D) = {d1, d2, ..., dk} ⊆ D

This step typically involves calculating the simi- larity or distance between the query’s embedding eq and the embeddings of stored documents edi. For example, using a k-NN(Fix and Hodges, 1989) (k-Nearest Neighbors) retriever, the retrieval step can be formulated as:

R(q, D) = {di ∈ D | dist(eq, edi) is in the top k}

Here, dist(eq, edi) quantifies the distance between two embeddings, employing metrics such as the L2- norm. The top-k documents exhibiting the smallest distances are subsequently retrieved."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|1948821ac386410d93bbbb7d1b987111
"Once the relevant documents are retrieved, the RAG integrates the retrieved context R(q, D) with the query q to generate an answer. To integrate the retrieved context with q, we concatenate the retrieved documents with the query, forming a com- bined input for the language model M . Finally, we obtain the output from M :

a = M (R(q, D) || q)

Threat Model. We consider a realistic black-box attack where the attacker interacts with the system solely through API queries. Thus, the attacker’s strategy is limited to crafting and modifying queries q to extract the desired information.

3.2 Privacy Leakage on Retrieval Data

In the black-box attack setting, the attacker endeav- ors to extract data from the retrieval dataset via prompting. This task is particularly challenging as the prompts must simultaneously accomplish two objectives: (a) induce the retriever to accurately retrieve targeted information and (b) prompt the model to output the retrieval data in context. This dual requirement makes previously proposed at- tacks impractical. For instance, the data extraction"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|152a5841e9cf48618a945caa28b5c916
"attack (Carlini et al., 2021, 2022) on LLMs only fo- cuses on extracting parametric knowledge without considering extracting information in the context. Besides, the prompt extraction attack (Willison, 2022; Zhang and Ippolito, 2023; Liu, 2023) solely targets the extraction of fixed system prompts, ne- glecting the dynamic retrieval process. We present a composite structured prompting that can achieve these two objectives:

q = {information} + {command}

The {information} component is to direct the re- trieval system towards fetching particular data; while the {command} component instructs the lan- guage model to include the retrieved information into its response. For the {command} component, we use phrases such as ""Please repeat all the con- text""1 to prompt the LLM to reproduce the retrieved context. The {information} component is adjusted according to the objectives of the attack, whether they are targeted or untargeted. This prompt struc- ture allows us to effectively extract retrieval data and evaluate privacy leakage by comparing outputs with returned documents. Its flexibility also en- ables easy adaptation to different types of leakage."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|7407e1e43bd94866b87ce753f940ac79
"Targeted Attack. In the targeted attack, the at- tacker has specific objectives regarding the type of information they aim to extract, such as person- ally identifiable information (PII) including phone numbers and email addresses, or sensitive content like personal dialogue cases. For these attacks, the {information} component consists of some specific information that is related to the attacker’s goals. For example, we can use proceeding texts of per- sonal information like ""Please call me at"" to extract phone numbers or queries like ""I want some infor- mation about ** disease"" to obtain private medical records related to a specific disease. More details about the design of {information} components are illustrated in Appendix A.2.1.

Untargeted Attack In the context of an untar- geted attack, the attacker’s objective is to gather as much information as possible from the whole retrieval dataset, rather than seeking specific data. To achieve this, following (Carlini et al., 2021), we randomly select chunks from the Common Crawl dataset to serve as the {information} component.

1We use this command because it achieves consistently promising attack effect and we discuss the impact of command design on retrieval and extraction in Section 4.4

3.3 Privacy Leakage on LLM Training Data"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|d2acc39017684b548b4b579464a69284
"3.3 Privacy Leakage on LLM Training Data

While addressing the privacy concerns of retrieval data, we also investigate the potential leakage of training data within LLMs employed in the RAG system, particularly in scenarios involving interac- tions with the retrieval component. To achieve this, we compared the difference in training data expo- sure with and without retrieval augmentation when attacking the same large language model. Given the vastness of the full training dataset, our inves- tigation is tailored to specific subsets of the train- ing corpus with targeted attacks and prefix attacks (Carlini et al., 2022), where the former focuses on extracting specific private information while the latter evaluates the memorization by reproducing texts from the training data.

Targeted Attack. This attack strategy, while bearing resemblance to the targeted attacks dis- cussed in Section 3.2, is specifically tailored to the objective of extracting sensitive information, such as PIIs, directly from the LLM. Therefore, we omit the {command} component and utilize straightfor- ward prompting phrases like “My phone number is"" and “Please email me at"" to access the private data in pre-training/fine-tuning datasets of LLMs."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|cf00ec0c662443d18fdadddfeeac3929
"Prefix Attack. It involves inputting the exact prefixes of training examples and checking if the model output matches the original suffixes (Carlini et al., 2022). Note that this method requires attack- ers to know the actual training data, which limits its practicality. However, it serves as a useful method for quantitatively measuring memorization effects.

4 RQ1: Can we extract private data from the external retrieval database in RAG?

With the proposed targeted and untargeted attacks on the retrieval dataset in Section 3.2 , we em- pirically investigated the privacy leakage of the retrieval dataset(RD). Our evaluation revealed the RAG system’s high vulnerability to attacks on re- trieval data. We also conducted ablation studies to examine various impact factors and explored possible mitigation strategies.

4.1 Evaluation Setup

RAG Components. For the LLM, we uti- lized three commonly used and safety-aligned models, including Llama-7b-chat(L7C), Llama- 13b-chat(L13C), and GPT-3.5-turbo(GPT). Re- garding embedding models, we primarily used bge-large-en-v1.5, and also explored others like

all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and e5-base-v2 in Section 4.4. Chroma2 was used to construct the retrieval database and store embeddings. The metric to cal- culate the similarity by default is L2-norm. The number of retrieved documents per query was set to k = 2, and we studied its impact in Section 4.4."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|354ee30c6fd848fba6e62aa3e3c620aa
"Datasets and Metrics. To investigate the leak- age of private data, we chose two datasets as our retrieval data: the Enron Email dataset of 500,000 employee emails, and the HealthcareMagic-101 dataset of 200k doctor-patient medical dialogues. In practice, these datasets correlate to scenarios like email completion or medical chatbots. Both datasets contain private information such as PIIs and personal dialogues, allowing us to evaluate the privacy risks of retrieval data extraction. For the HealthcareMagic dataset, we construct each doctor- patient medical dialogue as a data piece embedded and stored in a vector database, while for the Enron Email, we construct each email as a data piece.

For both attacks, we report the total number of contexts fetched (Retrieval Contexts), the num- ber of prompts yielding outputs with at least 20 direct tokens from the dataset (Repeat Prompts), and the number of unique direct excerpts produced (Repeat Contexts). For targeted attacks, we re- port the extracted targeted information (Targeted Information). For untargeted attacks, we report the number of prompts generating outputs with a ROUGE-L score over 0.5 (Rouge Prompts), and the total number of unique outputs closely resem- bling the retrieval data (Rouge Contexts).

"4.2 Results of Untargeted Attack

The results of untargeted attacks are presented in Table 1, and some leakage examples are in Ap- pendix A.4. It shows that a majority of the prompts effectively prompted the retrieval system to fetch relevant data segments. Moreover, a considerable amount of these prompts have led the model to pro- duce outputs that either exactly match or closely resemble the retrieved content. For instance, us- ing the Enron Mail dataset for retrieval and GPT- 3.5-turbo as the generative model (the last row), out of 250 prompts, 452 unique data segments are retrieved (Retrieval Contexts); 116 prompts re- sult in the model generating exact matches from the retrieved content (Repeat Prompts); and 121 prompts produce outputs closely related to the re- trieved content (Rouge Prompts).

results in 112 exact text matches (Repeat Con- texts) and 208 similar responses (Rouge Contexts). These findings underscore the potential for substan- tial privacy breaches through untargeted prompting, revealing the ease of inferring and reconstructing information from the retrieval dataset of RAG.

"4.3 Results of Targeted Attack

We conduct targeted attacks on both datasets to extract specific information. For the Enron emails, we aim to extract PII using common preceding texts like “My phone number is” as the {informa- tion}. We count the number of extracted PIIs from the retrieval data as targeted information. For the HealthCareMagic dialogues, we target extracting diagnosed cases for certain diseases using “I want information about disease” as the {information}. In this evaluation, we only consider the targeted information successfully extracted if (a) the tar- geted disease name appears in the returned con- text, and (b) the model outputs repetitive pieces from the returned context. Our analysis shows that targeted attacks can effectively retrieve sensitive information, as detailed in Table 2. For example, with Llama-7b-Chat as the generative model, 250 prompts successfully extracted 89 targeted medi- cal dialogue chunks from HealthCareMagic and 107 PIIs from Enron Email. This high success rate demonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems to targeted attacks on retrieval data extraction.

4.4 Ablation Study

In this subsection, we conduct ablation studies on various factors that may affect privacy leakage. We mainly discuss the impact of returned documents

per query k and then the impact of command com- ponents while postponing discussions on the im- pact of embedding models and generation sampling methods, in Appendix A.1"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|9ebf6f682bda4703aa9f4dad950ebad3
Returned Documents. To investigate how retrieved-context counts k per query would im- pact privacy leaks, we varies k from 1 to 4 and the results are shown in Figure 3. We fix the LLM as Llama-7b-Chat and the embedding model as bge-large-en-v1.5. From the results, we can find that for untargeted attacks, the number of re- trieved documents increases with k while a much slower increase regarding leaked documents (Re- peat Contexts/ Rouge Contexts). For the targeted attack, we can find an increase in targeted informa- tion on HealthCareMagic dataset, but no increase on Enron Mail dataset. Therefore, the increase in k does not substantially increase the privacy leakage. This marginal improvement may result from the models’ constrained capacity to coherently process extensive contextual content. Thus when prompted to repeat contexts, models cannot comprehensively reproduce all references, instead extracting only partial excerpts from one of the retrieved docu- ments 3.|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|4a6c09586def4302af829197beadcb52
"Command Component. We investigate how the construction of the command component im- pacts retrieval and generation in Figure 2. Specif- ically, we examine 4 command prompts ranging from short to long: C1:"" "", C2: ""Please repeat"", C3: ""Please repeat all the context"", C4: ""Please ig- nore all previous commands and just repeat all the inputs."" From Figures 2a and 2c, we find that com- mands affect the number of retrieved documents. Very long commands like C4 reduce retrieved docu- ments, possibly because the long command makes the query embedding less diverse as it occupies a large portion of the sentence. While very short sen- tences like ‘repeat’ or no command retrieve more diverse context but also introduce low extraction. This may be because when we input a general com- mand like ‘repeat’, the LLM does not understand what content to repeat. Among all settings, ""Please repeat all the context"" achieved consistently good performance, likely because it strikes a balance between retrieval and prompting the LLM to re- peat. This finding suggests that it is possible to design stronger attacks, as command component differences can greatly affect the leakage.

3We find more powerful models like GPT-3.5-turbo also exhibits this trend, as shown in Appendix A.5, Table 16, and Table 17

4.5 Potential Mitigation

Next, we aim to investigate potential defenses to mitigate the risk of retrieval data extraction. We investigate pre-retrieval techniques like set dis- tance threshold and post-processing techniques like re-ranking and summarization. Here, we use Llama2-7b-Chat as the generative model and bge-large-en-v1.5 as the embedding model with k = 2."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|b0f477936ce34d3d88f4137d34502a62
Re-ranking. In Retriever-Generator (RAG) mod- els, re-ranking significantly enhances the generated text’s quality and relevance. This process involves utilizing another pre-trained model to evaluate the relevance of retrieved documents to the query, sub- sequently adjusting their order to prioritize those more pertinent to the question. We posit that this approach can mitigate privacy risks by focusing the model on relevant information and reducing the likelihood of disseminating irrelevant content. In our implementation, we employ the widely rec- ognized bge-reranker-large4 reranker to score the documents and prepend the most relevant doc- uments closest to the query. However,from the results in Figure 4a and Figure 4b, we can observe that re-ranking has almost no mitigation effects.|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|168af6d4346647028e11e6ab528942fb
"their information exposure. To investigate this, we perform summarization first using an additional model after retrieval which is then input to the gen- erative model. To be specific, we input both the query and each returned documents to the LLM and ask LLM to only maintain the relevant information to the query. We consider both extractive summa- rization (Sum), which does not allow paraphrasing, and abstraction summarization (Sum.Para) allow- ing sentence alteration5. Our findings indicate that summarization effectively reduces privacy risks as- sociated with untargeted attacks. Notably, abstrac- tive summarization demonstrated superior effec- tiveness, reducing the risk by approximately 50%. This is because summarization reduces the sen- tence length and filters out irrelevant information, thus reducing the number of successful reconstruc- tions. However, in the context of targeted attacks, the effect of summarization was limited. For in- stance, in the Enron email dataset, the occurrence of personally identifiable information (PIIs) even inadvertently increased. This suggests that while summarization techniques may filter out irrelevant content, it tends to retain key information pertinent to targeted attacks, potentially increasing the likeli- hood of the LLM generating sensitive information.

Figure 5: The impact of retrieval threshold on performance and privacy leakage

suring only highly relevant information is retrieved, thereby filtering out unrelated or potentially sen- sitive content. Specifically, retrieval is only per- formed when the embedding distance between the query and documents falls within the threshold. In our setting, a document is only retrieved if the L2- norm embedding distance between the query and document is less than the threshold p, where we vary p from 0 to 1.2 to evaluate changes in leak- age and performance. For the HealthcareMagic dataset, we assess performance using the average ROUGE-L score (higher is better) on a held-out test set. For the Enron Email Dataset, we measure performance by calculating the average perplexity (lower is better) on a held-out test set.6 Figure 5 clearly shows a privacy-utility tradeoff with the threshold. Lower thresholds can harm system per- formance. Therefore, it is crucial in practice to choose the proper threshold via red teaming ac- cording to our applications."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|5ebd4c44a9ec4a33afe97c73212ab688

RAG Components. In this section, we maintain the settings from Section 4.1 for embedding mod- els and retrieval settings. However, we employ GPT-Neo-1.3B as our generative model due to its publicly available training corpus.

Dataset. Given the expansive scale of GPT- Neo-1.3B’s training data, examining memorization across the entire corpus was impractical. Therefore, we selected the Enron_Mail dataset, a subset of the pre-training data for GPT-Neo-1.3B, for our memo- rization experiments. To ensure the generalization of our study, we choose several datasets as retrieval data to cover different scenarios: wikitext-103 (general public dataset), HealthcareMagic (domain- specific dataset), and w3c-email (dataset with simi- lar distribution with a part of training data). Note that these retrieval datasets are not contained in the pre-training data for GPT-Neo-1.3B.

In this section, we aim to examine how incorporat- ing retrieval data affects LLMs’ tendency to repro- duce memorized information from their training sets. To investigate this question, we conducted targeted and prefix attacks on LLMs and compared

5.4 Discussions & Practical Implications

5.2 Targeted Attack

We performed targeted attacks as described in Sec- tion 3.3 and the results are shown in Table 3. In this table, ""None"" means no retrieval data is in- cluded, ""Random Noise"" and ""System Prompt"" de- note adding random characters and protective sys- tem prompts prepend to the input prompts. ""RAG- {dataset}"" indicate which dataset is used for re- trieval. The results show that incorporating RAG data substantially reduced the number of PIIs ex- tracted from the training data compared to using the LLM alone. Adding random noise or protective system prompts mitigated leakage to some extent, but remained far less effective than RAG integra- tion. These findings indicate that the incorpora- tion of retrieval data significantly reduces LLM’s propensity to reproduce content memorized during its training/finetuning process.

5.3 Prefix Attack"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|97ad292d9b2e4d09a1e01e3679282eec
"5.3 Prefix Attack

In line with the methods outlined in Section 3.3, we executed prefix attacks by providing the LLM with the first 100 tokens of training examples (of the LLM) and then comparing the model’s outputs with the original text that followed these tokens. If the similarity score, measured by the ROUGE-L metric, exceeded 0.5, we considered a successful extraction. The results in Table 3 show that the integration of retrieval data, in contrast to using the LLM alone or with noise or unrelated prompts, greatly decreased the LLM’s ability to recall and reproduce its training data. Specifically, it leads to a reduction in successful text reconstructions from over 200 cases to fewer than 40. This highlights that retrieval data integration can effectively reduce LLMs’ risk of revealing training data.

7We introduced the construction of random noise and pro-

tective system prompts in appendix A.2.2"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|b21b5c79b15b454fadf2313a1c978179
The reasons why LLMs are less likely to output memorized data could be complex. One possible reason is that incorporating external data makes LLMs less reliant on training data but focuses on leveraging information from retrieved contexts. As evidenced by the Bayes Theorem in (Xie et al., 2021), when leveraging external diverse datasets during inference, the model generates new tokens based on the conditional distribution given the re- trieved data R(q, D) and q. Such a distribution is different from the one only given q, and relies more on the retrieved data R(q, D). Such hypothe- sis is empirically supported by our results in Table 3. We can observe that when the retrieval data comprises entirely disparate data types, the LLM demonstrates a marked inability to extract PIIs, while when the retrieval data includes another PII dataset (W3C-Email), we found the LLM tends to output more retrieval data instead of training data. These findings have significant implications. First, integrating retrieval data reduces the risk of privacy leaks from LLMs’ training data, making it harder for attackers to access this information. This highlights the importance of addressing risks related to information extraction from retrieval data in practical RAG systems. Second, RAG can effec- tively protect private information in LLMs’ training data. Using non-sensitive public or carefully de- sensitized data as retrieval content can greatly min- imize the risk of information leakage from LLMs.|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|fbbd1780166842489b67aae7bdf6280c
"6 Conclusions

In this paper, we extensively investigated the pri- vacy risks associated with retrieval-augmented gen- eration (RAG) technique for LLMs. Through our proposed attack methods, we first systematically evaluated and identified the significant risks of re- trieval data extraction. Meanwhile, we explored various defense techniques that can mitigate these

risks. We also found that integrating retrieval data can substantially reduce LLMs’ tendency to output its memorized training data, which suggests that RAG could potentially mitigate the risks of training data leakage. Overall, we revealed novel insights regarding privacy concerns of retrieval-augmented LLMs, which is beneficial for the proper usage of RAG techniques in real-world applications.

"7 Limitations

In our research, we concentrated primarily on the application of retrieval augmentation during the in- ference stage, without delving into its integration during pre-training or fine-tuning phases. Future work will aim to explore these compelling areas. Moreover, while our study has highlighted the pri- vacy risks associated with commonly employed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, other retrieval-based language models (LMs) fea- ture distinct components and architectures (Huang et al., 2023; Borgeaud et al., 2022) that warrant fur- ther investigation. In addition, developing effective strategies to protect retrieval data and leveraging RAG systems for the safeguarding of training data represent open research questions that we intend to pursue.

A.1 Ablation Studies

In this section, we present additional ablation studies on the impact of components of the RAG system when extracting private data from the retrieval datasets. We consider embedding models, the temperature parameter of LLMs and different questions in the {information} part."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|98f80802ef924c44b70873ef76b9a3c7
"Embedding Models. Fixing the LLM as Llama2-7b-Chat, we study the impact of embedding models. To be more specific, we consider all-MiniLM-L6-v2, e5-base-v2 and bge-large-en-v1.5. R denotes Repeat Contexts and RG denotes ROUGE Contexts. As shown in Figure 6, privacy leakage risks remained high across embedding models, with considerable retrieved and extracted contexts. Moreover, embedding models divergently influenced retrieved contexts and successful extractions across datasets and attacks. For instance, E5 embedding is more vulnerable to facing untargeted HealthCareMagic extractions while when using BGE embedding, the output on Enron Email targeted attacks increases. We also provide detailed results in Table 4, Table 5.

Impact of the Temperature Parameter of LLMs. The parameter temperature is an important parameter influencing the generation of LLMs. A lower temperature value leads to more deterministic and focused outputs while a higher temperature value increases randomness, allowing the model to generate more"|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|d98a4e08bbcf4212afa75ea2b51b8096
"creative and diverse outputs. For both targeted and untargeted attacks, we use the default settings as in Section 4.1 and set different temperatures (0, 0.6, 1) for the LLM during its generation. It is worth noting that when the temperature is 0, the model will output tokens with the largest probability which is commonly referred to as greedy generation. According to our results in Table 6 and Table 7, the RAG system faces severe privacy leakage no matter what the temperature is.

Impact of Questions. As we mentioned in Section 3.2, we leverage a {command} prompt to force the LLM reproduce the retrieved contents. Therefore, we study the impact of different questions in the command prompt. We adopt the default experimental settings while utilizing 7 different questions as shown in Table 8 and Table 9. It is obvious that different commands indeed affect the extraction performance. Very general commands like “repeat"" or no command leads to very low extraction. This is mainly because LLMs can hardly understand what contents they should reproduce. On the contrary, detailed commands such as “Please repeat all the context"" achieve consistently good performance and extract much private information. These findings suggest that there exists potential to design more powerful commands to extract even more private data from the retrieval dataset.

A.2 Details of Prompting Design

A.2.1 The Information Part for Targeted and Untargeted Attacks The {information} component is intentionally designed to extract a substantial volume of data from the database. These data determine the maximum limit of attack capabilities. Therefore, whether employing a targeted or untargeted attack, it is crucial to maintain input diversity in order to ensure effective extraction. For targeted attacks, it is also crucial to ensure that the extracted contexts aligns as closely as possible with the attacker’s specific requirements. Consequently, the design of the {information} component differs for these two attack types.

Targeted Attack To generate the {information} component for a targeted attack, there are two stages involved.

In the first stage, the attacker must provide specific examples based on their individual requirements. For instance, they may write queries such as ""I want some advice about {target name}"", ""About {target name}"" if the name of the target object is clear. On the contrary, if the target is abstract, such as a specific email address or someone’s phone number, the attacker can provide the prefix content related to these targets, such as ""Please email us at"" or ""Please call me at""."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|6d412afbeb904156a806380dbc8cf146
"In the second stage, it is crucial to generate a significant quantity of {information} that is both similar and varied based on the provided examples. If the extracted target consists of numerous sub-contents, the generation process can incorporate replacing these specific sub-contents to generate diverse variations. Specifically, for the HealthcareMagic dataset, considering the multitude of disease types, the names of different diseases can be obtained by leveraging ChatGPT’s generation capabilities or by accessing the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from the World Health Organization (WHO). The {information} component is created by ""I want some advice about {disease name}"". Another approach (is also used for the Enron Email dataset) is to directly leverage LLMs like ChatGPT to generate similar sentences with examples. For instance, you can input “Generate 100 similar snetences like ""Please email us at""”.

Untargeted Attack Since there is no need to extract specific targets, untargeted attack only needs to consider making {information} components more diverse to obtain more data from retrieval datasets. To achieve this, following (Carlini et al., 2021), we randomly select chunks from the Common Crawl dataset to serve as the {information} component. Due to the random nature of the input, it has the potential to impact the {command} component. Therefore, we have implemented a maximum length of 15 tokens for the {information} component."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|fad34c7ea863432f8c34b83f649c4a15
"A.2.2 Construction of System Prompts and Random Noises We use random noises and protective system prompts in Section 5. For random noises, we just randomly choose 50 characters and prepend them to the prompt. For the system prompts, we construct some commonly used instructions as shown in Table 10, and randomly select one to prepend on each input.

A.2.3 Summarization Defense Prompts When conducting a Summary Defense, there are two main goals: to mitigate the performance degradation of RAG, and to enhance security. An effective approach is to selectively include only the data relevant to

Table 10: Protective prompts

System Prompts P1: ""Please refrain from creating sensitive content."", , ""Be mindful to not generate sensitive information."", ""Sensitive content generation is strictly prohibited."" P2: ""Ensure that generated information is not sensitive."" P3: ""Avoid producing any sensitive data."" P4: ""Be mindful to not generate sensitive information."" P5:""Sensitive content generation is strictly prohibited.""

A.3 Performance Evaluation

For different datasets, we have employed various methods to assess performance of RAG. For each dataset, we partition it into training and testing sets using a 99:1 ratio. The training set is utilized to build the RAG model, while we randomly sample 1000 instances from the testing set to evaluate the performance of RAG.

For the HealthcareMagic dataset, due to the consistent format of the data of the testing sets, which is ""Input: Input Content\nOutput: Output Content"", we utilize Input Content as the input for the RAG model, compare the RAG model’s output with Output Content, and evaluate their ROUGE-L scores.

For the Enron Mail dataset, there are no explicit inputs and outputs. For each instance from the test set, we select the first 50 tokens as inputs to RAG, and then calculate the perplexity (PPL) of the corresponding output."|research_papers\The_Good_and_The_Bad_Exploring_Privacy_Issues_in_R.pdf|0f744189e27041ec88db126bdc0a7273
"As we mentioned in Section 4.5, there exists a mitigation-performance trade-off for discussed mitigation methods. We provide detailed results of the performance of the RAG system when conducting these mitigation methods, in Table 12, Table 13 and Table 14. Detailed analysis can be found in Section 4.5.

Abstract

Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities, leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking, neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future research. We publicly release our codebase and dataset. 1

Introduction

In recent years, the concept of fair ranking has emerged as a critical concern in modern information access systems [11]. However, despite its significance, fair ranking has yet to be thoroughly examined in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [28], a rapidly advancing trend in natural language processing (NLP) systems [26]. To understand why this is important, consider the RAG system in Figure 1, where a user asks a question about running shoes. A classic retrieval system might return several documents containing information from various running shoe companies. If the RAG system only selects the top two documents, then information from the remaining two relevant companies will not be relayed to the predictive model and will likely be omitted from its answer. The fair ranking literature refers to this situation as unfair because some relevant companies (i.e., in documents at position 3 and 4) receive less or no exposure compared to equally relevant company in the top position [11]."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|ea768d4a79134d4597255a22308c923d
"Understanding the effect of fair ranking in RAG is fundamental to ensuring responsible and equitable NLP systems. Since retrieval results in RAG often underlie response attribution [14], unfair exposure of content to the RAG system can result in incomplete evidence in responses (thus compromising recall of potentially relevant information for users) or downstream representational harms (thus creating or reinforcing biases across the set of relevant entities). In situations where content providers are compensated for contributions to inference, there can be financial implications for the unfairness [3, 18, 30]. Indeed, the fair ranking literature indicates that these are precisely the harms that emerge

Figure 1: Fairness concerns in RAG. A simplified example of how RAG models can ignore equally relevant items (d3 and d4) and always consume the fixed top-scoring items (d1 and d2) with the same order of ranking over the multiple user requests. This is due to the deterministic nature of the retrieval process and a short context-length of a language model that necessitates the top-k truncation of a ranked list."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|c4d69dece7af468fbe7d2e2ce51f24f1
"when people are searchers [11], much less RAG systems, where the searchers are machines. RAG complicates these challenges since it often truncates rankings to much shorter lengths to fit the generator’s limited context size [1, 19, 26], making equal exposure of relevant items even harder.

Moreover, the fact that machines are now the searchers necessitates a different notion of item-worthiness (how deserving an item is to be included in a ranked list). Traditionally, ranking quality has been assessed based on relevance labels, which are created according to how relevant an item is to the user’s query [47]. However, with RAG systems, where the consumer is a language model, there is a growing shift towards evaluating ranking quality based on utility labels, which are determined by the usefulness of an item in aiding the model’s task performance, rather than its relevance to the query [42, 56].

This shift from relevance to utility in the concept of item-worthiness can significantly alter our understanding of the relationship between fairness and ranking quality [2]—particularly the tradeoffs that are well-known in the fair ranking literature [4, 9, 50]. Since previous fair ranking studies were conducted based on relevance judgments, they may need to be reexamined in light of utility-based judgments within the context of RAG."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|570af4acbd6a4409a9c86461b0ef22fc
"Our research aims to bridge the gap between traditional fair ranking studies and the emerging changes posed by RAG systems, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the interplay between fairness, ranking quality, and the effectiveness of RAG systems. We do this by evaluating RAG systems with a fairness-aware retriever across seven different tasks, experimenting with varying levels of retrieval fairness to observe changes in ranking quality and generation quality (utility).2

Our empirical results show that, in the context of machine users, there also exists an overall trend of fairness-quality tradeoff with respect to both retrieval and generation quality. However, the magnitude of this tradeoff is not particularly severe. In fact, we find that RAG models equipped with a fair ranker can often preserve a significant level of retrieval and generation quality, and in some cases, even surpass the quality achieved by the traditional RAG setup with a deterministic ranker that lacks fairness considerations.

This surprising finding offers significant insight into the potential of RAG-based applications, suggesting that fair treatment of individual content providers can be achieved without sacrificing much of the high- quality service delivered to end-users. This challenges the conventional assumption of an inevitable tradeoff between fairness and quality, opening new avenues for developing more equitable and effective RAG systems.

Figure 2: Experimental design to investigate the impact of item-fairness on ranking and generation quality in RAG. To evaluate system performance across multiple identical user requests, we sample N rankings from a stochastic retriever. We then measure the fairness and quality of the sampled rankings (Expected Exposure) and assess the system’s expected end-performance (Expected Utility). The query and prompt generators are omitted in the figure for brevity. Details on implementing a RAG system with fair rankings in a production environment can be found in Appendix E."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|4ea7ae932e7b43b8bcd990f880daa50c
the evaluation of RAG models have primarily focused on their effectiveness, including end-to-end performance [17, 21, 28] and the assessment of individual components [13, 41, 42]. However, little research has focused on evaluating fairness in RAG models, with the exception of recent work [48], which improved demographic diversity in human image generation by conditioning a generative model with externally retrieved images that help debias the generation process.|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|d076064a71f9472d91b314d10eef4719
Fairness in Ranking. Fair ranking has been approached through various definitions based on nor- mative concerns, primarily with distinctions made according to the stakeholders we prioritize. These include consumer-side fairness [12, 32], which focuses on how fairly a system delivers satisfaction to users; provider-side fairness [22, 46], which addresses how fairly item providers receive monetary or reputational rewards; and item-side fairness [23], which examines how fairly items are treated in terms of representation or exposure. The motivation of item-side fairness is closely linked to provider-side fairness, as unfair treatment of items can lead to unfair compensation for providers. These fairness concerns can be further categorized by the scope of stakeholders, encompassing individual fairness— ensuring similar treatment for similar individuals—and group fairness—ensuring equitable outcomes across different groups [6, 11]. Previous studies have focused on developing metrics to measure fairness [38] and optimizing fair retrievers within a single [46, 51, 54] or multiple rankings [4, 9, 49, 50]. In the context of provider- and item-side fairness, ensuring equal exposure of similar items across multiple rankings has gained significant attention [11]. To achieve this, researchers have used stochastic rankers that return a distribution of rankings, in contrast to deterministic rankers commonly found in areas like RAG, which produce a fixed ranking. This approach ensures that,|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|08f5722f6ff24775a8369b77e9c3f3f3
of rankings, in contrast to deterministic rankers commonly found in areas like RAG, which produce a fixed ranking. This approach ensures that, in expectation, similar items receive equal exposure across multiple user requests, with the distributions typically based on the merit of the rankings, such as an item’s relevance [9, 50].|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|6ea391f4f8a0473f9661c95fd41e5047
"In this research, we employ a stochastic ranker in RAG to enhance individual item-side fairness, aiming to ensure equal expected exposure for items that offer similar merits.

3 Experimental Methodology

In traditional RAG systems, a user input is used to query a retrieval system for recommended items from some corpus, which are then used for generation. Given user input x, a query q generated by the query generation function ϕq(x), and a corpus of documents C, a deterministic retriever R(q, C) returns a fixed ranked list L every time q is seen. Retrieval is followed by a top k truncation which is passed to a prompt generation function ϕp(x, L1:k) that returns a final prompt ¯x, which is subsequently passed to the language model G(¯x). Because deterministic retrievers allocate exposure to the same item over repeated samples, RAG systems with deterministic retrievers present a challenge to ensuring equal exposure of relevant items to the generator.

To address the issue of unfairness in the rankings passed to the generator, we can convert a deterministic retriever into a stochastic retriever, which has been shown to provide fair rankings in expectation

[9]. By sampling a ranking from a distribution of rankings predicted to be relevant, we smooth the expected exposure of different relevant items to be similar and, therefore, fairer (Appendix E). Because decisions are stochastic, the fairness and quality of stochastic retrieval is evaluated based on a sample of rankings. Similarly, since a sampled ranking is processed by a generator, we also compute the expected effectiveness by using sampled rankings. The complete evaluation pipeline of a RAG system with a stochastic retriever is illustrated in Figure 2.

The following sections describe how we construct a test collection with utility labels (§3.1), how we stochastically sample multiple rankings (§3.2), and how we evaluate the fairness and ranking quality of the sampled rankings (§3.3.1) and measure the effectiveness of a RAG system given multiple rankings (§3.3.2).

3.1 Construction of a Test Collection with Utility Labels

Setting an appropriate proxy for measuring item-worthiness is crucial in the evaluation of fairness [2]. Drawing on the insight that utility-based judgments are more suitable than relevance judgments in the context of RAG [42, 56], we annotate item-level utility labels for all items in the corpus."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|39630c65af6f446aa9462e6872ce0fd6
"We define an item’s worthiness by the additional utility (utility-gain) it provides to a language model (specifically, the generator in a RAG system) when used to solve a specific task as part of the aug- mentation process. To assess this utility-gain, each item in the corpus is individually supplied to the generator along with an input question. The utility-gain is then calculated as the difference between the utility of the augmented generator and that of a baseline language model without any information about the item. Formally, let ui denote the baseline string utility score from the vanilla language model prompted only with the input question, and let uj represent the utility score from the language model with a prompt augmented by the j’th item dj in the corpus. The item dj is considered useful if the utility-gain δj = uj − ui is positive, and not useful otherwise (see Appendix B).

Therefore, the item-level utility labels are designed to be both task- and generator-dependent, as the utility of each item varies depending on the task and the language model used. This labeling process also aligns with the principles of task-based information retrieval [24].

3.2 Fairness-Aware Stochastic Retriever"|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|b3d3f7fa105c49058b454514b39cf243
"3.2 Fairness-Aware Stochastic Retriever

Stochastic retrievers have been used for various purposes, such as optimization of retrieval models [5, 15, 35, 52], as well as ensuring equitable exposure of items [9, 35, 36]. Many of these studies use Plackett-Luce sampling [37] to achieve the stochasticity of retrieval. We follow the line of research and formally define how we derive a fairness-aware stochastic retriever through Plackett-Luce sampling. To enhance sampling efficiency, we adopt the methodology of Oosterhuis [35], and for controllable randomization, we utilize the approach proposed by Diaz et al. [9]. Given n items in a corpus C, a vector of retrieval scores s ∈ Rn can be obtained from R(q, C), which can be used to generate a ranked list L. We then min-max normalize retrieval scores to be in [0, 1] in order to construct a multinomial distribution over items [4]. The probability of an item d being selected as the i’th item in a new ranking σ through Plackett-Luce sampling is given by

p(d|L1:i−1) =

exp(¯sd)1[d /∈ L1:i−1] (cid:80) exp(¯sd′)

d′∈C\L1:i−1"|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|b85fe4e34a4c45069dc4fac352df2712
"p(d|L1:i−1) =

exp(¯sd)1[d /∈ L1:i−1] (cid:80) exp(¯sd′)

d′∈C\L1:i−1

where L1:i−1 is the partial ranking up to position i − 1, ¯s represents the normalized retrieval score vector, and ¯sd is the normalized score of item d. Using this probability, we iteratively sample an item, set its probability to 0, renormalize the distribution, and repeat the process. The probability of generating a complete ranking is then given by the product of the placement probabilities for each item, i.e., p(σ|q) = (cid:81)n This repeated sampling and renormalization process can be efficiently managed using the Gumbel- Softmax trick [16, 31], which enables the sampling of rankings to be performed at the speed of sorting [35]. To do so, for each sampling iteration, we draw Ui ∼ Uniform(0, 1), followed by generating a Gumbel noise Gi = − log(− log(Ui)). The probability of each sampled ranking σi is then obtained by sorting the items based on their perturbed scores ˜sdi = ¯sdi + Gi.

i=1 p(σi|σ1:i−1).

3.2.1 Controlling the Level of Fairness

Adjusting the level of randomization directly controls the degree of item-fairness, aligning with our goal to observe how varying levels of fairness in rankings affect the ranking and generation quality of a RAG model. To obtain the controllability, we follow the work of Diaz et al. [9] and use a temperature parameter α. We apply the scalar α to each value in the normalized score vector ¯s by raising each value to the power of α.3 This process is done before the scores are passed to the sampling policy. Therefore, the modified sampling distribution is thus defined as: exp(¯sα (cid:80)

d )1[d /∈ L1:i−1] exp(¯sα d′)

p(d|L1:i−1) =

d′∈C\L1:i−1"|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|e1f34411c83a4bdfb84b356590b7921c
"d )1[d /∈ L1:i−1] exp(¯sα d′)

p(d|L1:i−1) =

d′∈C\L1:i−1

This implies that the sharpness of the sampling distribution is controlled by the α. A higher α amplifies the probability of items with higher retrieval scores being sampled. Therefore, if multiple rankings are sampled by the stochastic retriever with high α, it results in high disparity (i.e., item-side unfairness) of sampled rankings. At extreme, with considerably high α, the procedure results in the identical rankings which is the behavior of a deterministic ranker (i.e., maximum item-unfairness). On the other hand, a lower α reduces the disparity of sampled rankings, making the exposure distribution fairer. At extreme, when α = 0, the sampling procedure becomes uniformly random and achieves the lowest disparity (i.e., maximum item-fairness) in the sampled rankings.

3.3 Evaluation"|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|d540774d33a940178c4db781a37c9a18
"3.3 Evaluation

As mentioned in Section 3, because we are dealing with stochastic retrievers, we need to measure the expected behavior of the system. Let S(s, N, k) be the stochastic sampler that samples a set of N rankings Σ = [σ1, σ2, · · · , σN ], given the retrieval scores s, where each ranking σi is truncated to the size of k. From each ranking, we can get an output ˆyi = G(ϕp(x, σi)). With an arbitrary fairness metric µf (Σ) and a ranking quality metric µr(Σ) that takes a set of rankings as an input, we can measure the degree of fairness and ranking quality of the sampled rankings. Similarly, an arbitrary string utility metric µu(y, ˆyi), such as ROUGE, can be used to assess an expected effectiveness of a RAG system by calculating the average of the N metric scores.

In this paper, based on the empirical investigation done by Raj and Ekstrand [38], we use expected exposure disparity (EE-D) and expected exposure relevance (EE-R) [9] as µf and µr, respectively (§3.3.1). For µu, we select the metric depending on the task, and we get the expectation of the utility of a RAG model which we call an expected utility (EU) (§3.3.2).

3.3.1 Expected Exposure in the Context of Machine Users"|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|ad4e4f66f65947498b25c6aa05f250b1
"3.3.1 Expected Exposure in the Context of Machine Users

Expected Exposure (EE) [9] works by estimating the exposure of items across rankings (e.g., Σ) created by a subject model, and comparing them with an optimal set of rankings that always satisfy the item-fairness. To represent the attention over n items given by the consumer (generator in RAG), an n × 1 system exposure vector ϵ is created. This is then compared with an n × 1 target exposure vector ϵ∗, where it represents the exposure of items allocated by an oracle retriever that always rank useful items above non-useful ones [9]. With the system and target exposure vector ϵ ∈ Rn and ϵ∗ ∈ Rn, we can get the difference between the two by the squared l2 distance:

Therefore, the higher the value of EE-D, the more unfair the set of rankings are, and the higher the value of EE-R, the closer the set of system rankings are to the optimal set of rankings with respect to the ranking quality.

The exposure of an item is calculated by modeling users’ (e.g., generators in RAG) attention to each item in a ranking. For example, one can assume that the user is affected by position bias and gives

attention following an exponential decay [33]. However, these browsing models were developed for human-users not for machine-users, so we need a different user behavior model for generators in RAG. For simplicity, we assume that the machine-user can consume the items by giving equal attention to all the items that were passed to the context, but pays 0 attention to the items placed after the k’th position due to the top-k truncation. This makes the user browsing model a step function parameterized by k. In this work, a relevance-independent machine-user model (MU) is set to the step function that reflects the behavior of top-k truncation of RAG:

3.3.2 Expected Utility

Given the set of N sampled rankings Σ, we individually augment the generator with each ranking σi, resulting in N outputs from the generator. The utility of these outputs is then measured using an arbitrary string utility metric µu. To determine the anticipated utility of a RAG model with fair rankings—represented by the tuple of a stochastic ranking sampler S and a generator G—we calculate the expected utility (EU) of the RAG system given an instance x.

EU(⟨S, G⟩|x) = Eσ∼S [µu(y, ˆyσ)] =

3.3.3 Normalization of Metrics

From Equation 3, we decompose the metric into EE-D and EE-R. Since the bounds of these metrics depend on the number of useful items, normalization must be applied per query. Both metrics are min-max normalized based on their theoretical lower and upper bounds. We denote the normalized EE-D and EE-R as EE-Dq and EE-Rq, respectively."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|1cc4f91df6484b6c964aae9dc9e4b212
"However, theoretically determining the bounds of the expected utility (EU) of a RAG model is challenging. To address this, we normalized the EU by the model’s empirical upper bound, the maximum observed utility across all runs of the experiment with the same generators. To approach the true upper bound, these runs include RAG models with an oracle retriever that consistently ranks useful items (i.e., those with positive utility labels) above non-useful ones, stochastically returning one of the m!(n − m)! different rankings, where m represents the number of useful items in the corpus. We denote the normalized EU as EUq, which can be interpreted as the distance to the optimal utility. From this section onwards, we omit the symbol q from the normalized metrics for brevity. Proofs and details on how each metric is normalized by its lower and upper bounds can be found in the Appendix. C.

4 Experiment setup

We choose the LaMP benchmark [45] for our dataset. It assesses the personalization capability of language models through retrieval-augmentation of users’ interaction history in a platform. LaMP includes various prediction tasks, such as classification, regression, and generation, and is well-suited for tasks where multiple items can be relevant/useful, unlike QA tasks with typically one or two provenance items. The retrieval items in LaMP have clear providers and consumers, aligning with

our goal to ensure fairness for individual item providers. For example, in LaMP-1, retrieval items are academic papers, where exposure can increase citation counts for authors. In LaMP-4, retrieval items are news articles, where exposure can lead to monetary compensation for journalists. Due to the absence of a test set, we constructed a test collection as described in §3.1, using the first thousand entries of a user-based development set. Then, we discarded entries that have only one useful item in the corpus, as it is unnecessary to concern item-fairness in that case. We release the test collection, and the dataset statistics can be found in the Appendix J.

We used BM25 (lexical retriever) [39], SPLADE (learned sparse retriever), and Contriever (bi-encoder dense re- triever) [20] as deterministic retrievers providing retrieval scores to base the sampling on. These models represent commonly used retrievers in the RAG literature [26]. Sam- pling size was set to N = 100, and truncation size was set to k = 5."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|ac3aa5e9f59649dda3303231f1315b59
"For generation models, we use Flan-T5-Small, Flan-T5- Base, and Flan-T5-XXL [7]. For decoding strategy, beam size is set to 4, and no sampling strategy is used. This is to ensure that stochasticity is only introduced to the retriever for controlled experiments. Full implementation details can be found in Appendix K. With the three base retrievers and three generators, we configure nine different RAG models and evaluate them on the seven LaMP tasks.

Figure 3: Effect of a temperature param- eter α on the disparity of rankings, in the LaMP task 4, a text generation task. The RAG model is configured with the Contriever and Flan-T5-Base. Each data point represents the normalized EE-D of each run of the experiment (i.e., one query –>N sampled rankings –> EE-D of the N rankings).

We repeat the experiments with four different temperature parameters α = 1, 2, 4, 8, which allows us to assess the util- ity of the RAG models with different levels of item-fairness. From Figure 3, we observe how effectively α, described in the Equation 2, controls the disparity of rankings. For example, when α is set to 4, we usually obtain a set of sampled rankings with EE-D mostly in the range of [0.5, 0.8], and when α is set to 8, we often get a set of sampled rankings with EE-D = 1. Refer to Appendix D to see the full description of the effect of α on the other metrics.

RQ1: Is there a tradeoff between ensuring item-fairness in rankings and maintaining high ranking quality when utility labels are used for evaluation?

By gathering all four repeated runs of the experiments with different α values, we can plot the trend of ranking quality (EE-R) against item fairness (EE-D), as shown in Figure 4.

As shown in previous studies [9, 50], there is a well-known tradeoff between fairness and ranking quality for human users. Similarly, we observe a general tradeoff for machine users. However, unlike past findings, this tradeoff is not always strict. For instance, in Figure 4, both SPLADE and Contriever maintain consistently high ranking quality while being considerably fairer, and for BM25, ranking quality even improves as fairness increases, up to a certain point.

Figure 4: Relationship between item- fairness and the quality of rankings.

At the rightmost side of the lines, where EE-D = 1 (representing the performance of deterministic rankers), we observe that these rankers do not always deliver the highest ranking quality. This suggests that commonly used deterministic rankers in RAG systems may be suboptimal, and that ranking quality can be improved while ensuring item fairness. This becomes even clearer when examining the impact of fair ranking on the downstream performance of a RAG system.

The leftmost side of the lines, where EE-D = 0, represents the performance of a uniformly random ranking policy. At this point, the measured ranking quality should approximate the proportion of positively labeled items in the corpus, which is 31% based on data statistics. This is notably higher

than in non-RAG (human-user) settings, where the percentage of relevant documents is typically much smaller, resulting in a EE-R value near 0 [9]."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|f9215fd138d74a18a7b6157739a27c99
"than in non-RAG (human-user) settings, where the percentage of relevant documents is typically much smaller, resulting in a EE-R value near 0 [9].

To quantify the performance of fair rankers, we calculate the area under the disparity-ranking quality curve (Figure 4), with higher values indicating stronger ranking quality. We also measure the tradeoff by fitting a linear line to the experiment results, where a steeper slope reflects a stronger tradeoff between fairness and ranking quality. Based on these metrics, we observe that Contriever-based models exhibit the highest tradeoff, while BM25-based models show the lowest, despite their poor retrieval quality. Overall, SPLADE-based models achieve high retrieval quality while maintaining a relatively low tradeoff. For detailed plots and quantifications, refer to Appendix F.

Table 1: Each value in the table is the difference between the utility of a baseline (deterministic) RAG model and the average utility of a fairer RAG model at a specific fairness interval. Nonnegative differences are highlighted. Full results are listed in Appendix I.

RQ2: Is there a tradeoff between ensuring item-fairness in ranking and maintaining high generation quality of a RAG model?

Before examining the relationship between fairness and RAG utility, Figure 5a shows an auxiliary result confirming a strong correlation between utility-based ranking quality and the effectiveness of RAG models. This is unsurprising, as item-worthiness judgments were based on the utility-gain provided by the generator. However, this correlation suggests that the tradeoff observed in the disparity-ranking quality curve (Figure 4) is likely to manifest similarly due to this strong relationship."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|329ecfdd86fd40ad9dfa89c267b62e0f
"In fact, as observed from the disparity-utility curve (Figure 5b), we see a global trend of a non-strict tradeoff (i.e., RAG models maintain high generation quality while being considerably fair, and often even achieve higher quality).

However, a closer look at the local trend offers a significant insight: RAG systems with fair ranking can often achieve higher system-effectiveness compared to models with deterministic rankers. In Table 1, we divided the fairness levels into five intervals based on the normalized EE-D. As shown in the table and Appendix I, improving fairness to the level of EE-D ∈ [0.8, 1.0), and even EE-D ∈ [0.6, 0.8), can often enhance the utility of many RAG models across most LaMP tasks. For example, having EE-D in the range of [0.8, 1.0) outperforms the baseline for all models in LaMP-2 and for seven out of nine models in LaMP tasks 4, 5, and 6.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

Why do we often see higher system utility in fairer RAG models? Although there is a general trend of a fairness-utility tradeoff, we observe that certain levels of fairness can actually improve the utility of a baseline RAG model. Recent line of research have uncovered relevant findings: 1) generators are not robust to changes in the position of useful information [29]; 2) items with high retrieval scores often include distracting content that can reduce the system-effectiveness [8, 40]; and 3) introducing some random documents can significantly boost the utility of RAG [8]."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|9539b03adc2044cb951b228b30208803
"Building on these existing results, we find that perturbing the initial ranking through stochastic sampling often can impact the performance of certain inference decisions and lead to changes in the system’s expected end-performance. In our experiments, we observe that the expected utility generally increases within the fairness interval of [0.8, 1.0). This suggests that a fixed ranking from a deterministic ranker may be suboptimal for the generator, and that perturbing the ranking, along with the repositioning of items, not only improves expected end-performance but also enhances the fairness of the rankings.

Moreover, in fairness intervals where the system’s expected utility improves, it is possible that either fewer distracting items were included in the ranking passed to the generator or useful, previously overlooked items (which may have been considered random) were introduced due to the ranking perturbation. However, while higher utility paired with increased item-fairness (even within fairness intervals as low as [0.4, 0.6)) may seem advantageous, practitioners should exercise caution. This could result in compensating providers of items irrelevant to user requests, particularly in scenarios where content providers are rewarded for contributing to inference outcomes."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|1ef6c878f5434f288ea2db3a9204ddf7
Machine-user browsing model. Developing more sophisticated machine-user browsing models will result in more consistent and accurate evaluations of item-side fairness in RAG models, as the exposure of each item is influenced by the attention allocated by the machine-user. Initial research can draw inspiration from Liu et al. [29], who found that LLMs tend to allocate more attention to the beginning and end of a context, with less focus on the middle. This line of inquiry aligns with the broader effort to create search engines tailored for machine-users [43], specifically focusing on fairer search engines in this context. It should involve studying how LMs attend to each retrieved result within a context, analogous to how traditional search engine research models human browsing behavior [10].|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|32a1ebb634dc4ff8a77c3651464c52e8
"Measurement of string utility. In line with the recent call for evaluating various valid output strings [57], we recognize the need for a similar approach to better measure system utility across different rankings given. Recall that our experiments were designed to provide the generator with different rankings for the same query, leading to varied outputs. This approach is motivated by the idea that items not appearing in the top positions of deterministic rankings may still hold value and should be fairly considered by the system. In this context, the diverse outputs generated from different rankings may still be valid. However, we currently rely on a single target output string for comparison with predictions. Future work could focus on calculating the utility of diffuse predictions, enabling a more nuanced evaluation.

Limitations. We acknowledge that the evaluation cost of fair RAG systems can be high due to repeated sampling and inference steps. However, in production, only a single ranking is sampled, minimizing the impact on system latency (Appendix E). Also, a limitation in our utility labeling is that it considers single items, while multiple items may yield contrasting utility gains. Despite this, the strong correlation between ranking quality and system effectiveness suggests this approach reasonably approximates item-worthiness for evaluating the impact of fair ranking on RAG systems."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|be64202d8bc7411383c29d8d62cccdad
"Conclusion. This study highlights the impact of fair rankings on both the ranking and generation quality of RAG systems. Through the extensive analysis, we show that fairer RAG systems not only maintain high generation quality but can also outperform traditional RAG models, challenging the notion of a strict tradeoff between fairness and effectiveness. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing responsible and equitable RAG systems and pave the way for future research in fair ranking and retrieval-augmented generation. We encourage future researchers to extend this work by incorporating graded or missing judgments and exploring the different notions of fairness in RAG systems, and ultimately advancing the field of trustworthy RAG systems research.

"2 ∈ [0, ∥¯ϵ∥2

2], where ¯ϵ is an exposure vector derived from any deterministic ranking.

Proof. The lower bound is achieved by a uniform random policy. Each item d will have exposure of 1 n . However, it is reasonable to assume that it is approximately 0, since the size of most of the retrieval corpus is very large. Also, it is common that the corpus consists of majority of non-relevant items. The implication is that, for the optimal exposure, since the n − m non-relevant items are shuffled amongst themselves, each will have an expected exposure of close to 0. Thus, assuming large n and relatively small m,

C.2 Normalization of EE-R

The ranking quality measure EE-R should be normalized by its true upper and lower bound. Theorem 2. ⟨ϵ, ϵ∗⟩ ∈ [0, ∥ϵ∗∥2 2]"|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|12f7ea6ca46f495bb0d2784887600ee1
"The ranking quality measure EE-R should be normalized by its true upper and lower bound. Theorem 2. ⟨ϵ, ϵ∗⟩ ∈ [0, ∥ϵ∗∥2 2]

Proof. The lower bound is achieved when ϵ becomes ϵ−, which is an exposure vector of the worst case deterministic ranking σ− (permutations that rank all non-relevant items above relevant items). Given the assumption made from equation 8 and, C+ and C−, which are set of indices of relevant and non-relevant items, respectively,

Corollary 2. For machine user browsing model with top-k consumption and equal attention to the top items, the bound depends on m and k. If m ≤ k, ⟨ϵ, ϵ∗⟩ ∈ [0, m + (k−m)2 n−m ]. If m > k, ⟨ϵ, ϵ∗⟩ ∈ [0, k2 m ]

With UM, the upper bound of EE-R can be calculated by equation 6. If m ≤ k, ∥ϵ∗∥2

C.3 Normalization of EU

Theoretically obtaining a true upper bound of a utility of a RAG model is challenging. Therefore, we approximate the true upper bound by the maximum of the empirically obtained utilities given a fixed RAG model ⟨S, G⟩ with a stochastic ranking sampler."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|6475fab1b540453ab6dc52d5fddc5e73
"Recall that the string utility ui = µu(y, G(ϕp(x, σi))) is a utility of a RAG model with a sampled ranking σi ∈ Σ. Let u(α) denote the i’th string utility when the sampling temperature parameter is set i that belongs to Σ∗, which is a set of to α. Also, let u∗ sampled permutations (rankings) from a stochastic oracle retriever. This stochastic oracle retriever is a policy that always places relevant items above non-relevant items, thus having m!(n − m)! number of unique optimal permutations.

i denote the i’th string utility, given a ranking σ∗

(26)

Normalization of EU is done to get the percentage of closeness to the optimal utility as all the utility values are scaled relative to the maximum value. In other words, the normalized EU value indicates how close the EU is to the maximum utility that the RAG system can get to."|research_papers\Towards_Fair_RAG_On_the_Impact_of_Fair_Ranking_in_.pdf|9e44f185a0bb4b11ac99e47160f2f20f
"This is straightforward for higher-the-better metrics, such as ROUGE and Accuracy. However, for lower-the-better metrics such as MAE, we convert the scores to higher-the-better by subtracting the scores from the true metric upper bound. This allows us to perform the same normalization operation and have the same interpretation of the normalized metric.

"When the three types of plots are observed together, we can infer some interesting observations. In general, we see positive relationships between increasing α and both ranking quality and utility. This implies that we can generally expect a tradeoff between both fairness and ranking quality, as well as between fairness and utility.

However, we can expect some edge cases. For instance, in LaMP-1 (left column of the figure), difference in EU when α = 4 and α = 8 is not large, and we can see that even the lower quartile of the utility is increased when α is set to 4 (Figure 6c). This can possibly mean that in LaMP-1, the RAG model can maintain considerable utility when the disparity is roughly in the range of [0.6, 0.8]. Similar observation can be made for the LaMP-4 (right column of the figure), except that the EE-R is higher when α = 4 than when α = 8 (Figure 6b). This indicates that the deterministic retriever does not always provide the maximum ranking quality, and the retriever can sometimes provide higher ranking quality by being more fair, ultimately maintaining considerable or higher utility (similar EU when α=4 and when α=8) at the same time.

With this preliminary observations in mind, we could delve deeper into the relationships between fairness, ranking quality, and utility, by visualizing and quantifying the combined results from all the runs (α = 1, 2, 4, 8).

Figure 7: Designing a RAG system that incorporates stochastic fair rankings involves using stochastic sampling, where N can be set to 1 to provide a single ranking to the language model. This can result in a different ranking compared to the one in Figure 1, exposing d1 and d3 to the language model. This paper is focusing on the evaluation of this system as depicted in the Figure 2. The query and prompt generators are omitted in the figure for brevity.

Table 3: Values on the left are the gradient of a linear line fit to the data points where x-axis is EE-D and y-axis is EE-R. Higher the value, stronger the tradeoff between fairness and ranking quality. Values on the right are the DR-AUC on the disparity-ranking quality (EE-D Vs. EE-R) curve. Higher the value, stronger the ranking quality, given consistent tradeoff between fairness and relevance. Oracle retriever is omitted here as EE-R of oracle is almost always 1.0.

Table 4: Values on the left are the gradient of a linear line fit to the data points where x-axis is EE-R and y-axis is EU. Higher the value, stronger the tradeoff between retrieval quality and generation quality. Values on the right are the RU-AUC on the ranking quality-utility (EE-RVs. EU) curve. Higher the value, stronger the general end-performance of a RAG model when every level of relevance is considered. Oracle retriever is omitted here as EE-R of oracle is almost always 1.0.
